To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale and the clouds that had hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went away, and in a while they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker green to protect themselves, and they did not spread any more. The surface of the earth crusted, a thin hard crust, and as the sky became pale, so the earth became pale, pink in the red country and white in the gray country.

在俄克拉荷马的红土之乡与部分灰土之乡，最后的几场雨下得轻柔，未曾切开这片伤痕累累的土地。犁耙来回穿梭，抚平了细流冲刷的沟痕。这最后的雨水催着玉米拔节而上，也让路边的野草与青草四处蔓生，绿色的外衣渐渐掩去了灰土与暗红的土地。到了五月下旬，天空变得苍白，春天里久悬高空的一团团云絮也消散了。烈日日复一日地炙烤着茁壮的玉米，直到每片碧绿的剑叶边缘都蔓延开一道褐色焦痕。云来复去，盘桓一阵，终不再现。野草为求自保，颜色转为深绿，亦不再蔓延。土地表层结了一层薄薄的硬壳。天色既已苍白，大地也随之失色——红土之地泛着粉色，灰土之地则化为一片白茫。

In the water-cut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams. Gophers and ant lions started small avalanches. And as the sharp sun struck day after day, the leaves of the young corn became less stiff and erect; they bent in a curve at first, and then, as the central ribs of strength grew weak, each leaf tilted downward. Then it was June, and the sun shone more fiercely. The brown lines on the corn leaves widened and moved in on the central ribs. The weeds frayed and edged back toward their roots. The air was thin and the sky more pale; and every day the earth paled.

水冲的沟壑里，细碎的干土簌簌滑落，如涓涓干流。穴居沙龟和蚁蛉的活动，引得泥土小片小片地塌落。毒辣的日头天天暴晒，玉米的嫩叶不再那么挺拔；起初只是弯成一道弧线，而后，随着支撑力量的叶脉日渐衰弱，每片叶子都垂落下来。转眼到了六月，阳光愈发炽烈。玉米叶上的褐色焦痕不断扩大，向中央的叶脉侵去。野草叶片枯萎，边缘卷缩，向根部退去。空气稀薄，天空愈发苍白；大地也日甚一日地失色。

In the roads where the teams moved, where the wheels milled the ground and the hooves of the horses beat the ground, the dirt crust broke and the dust formed. Every moving thing lifted the dust into theair: a walking man lifted a thin layer as high as his waist, and a wagon lifted the dust as high as the fence tops, and an automobile boiled a cloud behind it. The dust was long in settling back again.

路上，车马队走过，车轮碾轧，马蹄敲击，地表的硬壳碎裂开来，化为尘土。凡是移动的东西，都会扬起尘土：行人走过，会扬起一层齐腰的薄尘；大车驶过，尘土会上扬到篱笆顶那么高；汽车开过，则在身后卷起一团翻滚的尘雾。尘土久久不落。

When June was half gone, the big clouds moved up out of Texas and the Gulf, high heavy clouds, rain-heads. The men in the fields looked up at the clouds and sniffed at them and held wet fingers up to sense the wind. And the horses were nervous while the clouds were up. The rain-heads dropped a little spattering and hurried on to some other country. Behind them the sky was pale again and the sun flared. In the dust there were drop craters where the rain had fallen, and there were clean splashes on the corn, and that was all.

六月过半，大团的雨云从德克萨斯和墨西哥湾移来，高悬空中，厚重无比。田里的男人们仰望云团，嗅着云里雨的味道，还伸出湿润的手指感知风向。云起之时，马匹也焦躁不安。然而，雨云只洒落几滴雨点，便匆匆向别处赶去。云后，天空复又苍白，烈日当空。尘土上留下了雨点砸出的小坑，玉米叶上溅了几点干净的水痕，仅此而已。

A gentle wind followed the rain clouds, driving them on northward, a wind that softly clashed the drying corn. A day went by and the wind increased, steady, unbroken by gusts. The dust from the roads fluffed up and spread out and fell on the weeds beside the fields, and fell into the fields a little way. Now the wind grew strong and hard and it worked at the rain crust in the corn fields. Little by little the sky was darkened by the mixing dust, and the wind felt over the earth, loosened the dust, and carried it away. The wind grew stronger. The rain crust broke and the dust lifted up out of the fields and drove gray plumes into the air like sluggish smoke. The corn threshed the wind and made a dry, rushing sound. The finest dust did not settle back to earth now, but disappeared into the darkening sky.

一阵微风追随雨云，催着它们向北而去，轻柔地拂过干枯的玉米秆，发出一阵沙沙声响。一天过去，风势渐强，持续不断，没有一丝间歇。路上的尘土蓬松地扬起，四散开去，落在田边的野草上，也落入田里少许。此刻，风变得强硬起来，开始侵蚀玉米地里那层雨后结成的硬壳。渐渐地，天空因混入的尘埃而暗淡下来，风在大地上摸索，将尘土吹松，卷走。风势更强了。地表的硬壳终于破裂，田里的尘土冲天而起，一股股灰色的烟尘升入空中，如同滞重的浓烟。玉米秆在风中摇曳，发出干涩的呼啸。最细微的粉尘，不再落回地面，而是消融在愈发昏暗的天空里。

The wind grew stronger, whisked under stones, carried up straws and old leaves, and even little clods, marking its course as it sailed across the fields. The air and the sky darkened and through them the sun shone redly, and there was a raw sting in the air. During a night the wind raced faster over the land, dug cunningly among the rootlets of the corn, and the corn fought the wind with its weakened leaves until the roots were freed by the prying wind and then each stalk settled wearily sideways toward the earth and pointed the direction of the wind.

风势愈发猛烈，飕飕地钻过石头底下，卷起禾草、枯叶，甚至小土块，在田野上掠过，留下一道道痕迹。空气和天空都暗了下来，太阳透过其间，发出红光，空气里有股生涩的刺鼻味道。一夜之间，风在陆地上加速狂奔，狡猾地钻探玉米的根须，玉米用衰弱的叶子与风搏斗，直到根部被这撬挖的风刨松，于是，每一棵玉米秆都精疲力尽地歪倒在地，指向风去的方向。

The dawn came, but no day. In the gray sky a red sun appeared, a dim red circle that gave a little light, like dusk; and as that day advanced, the dusk slipped back toward darkness, and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn.

黎明已至，白昼未临。灰蒙蒙的天空里，一轮红日显现，是个暗淡的圆盘，发出微光，恍如黄昏；而随着白日推移，这片昏暗又向着黑暗退去，唯有风在倒伏的玉米地上空悲鸣、呜咽。

Men and women huddled in their houses, and they tied handkerchiefs over their noses when they went out, and wore goggles to protect their eyes.

男男女女都蜷缩在屋里，出门时用手帕捂住口鼻，戴上护目镜保护眼睛。

When the night came again it was black night, for the stars could not pierce the dust to get down, and the window lights could not even spread beyond their own yards. Now the dust was evenly mixed with the air, an emulsion of dust and air. Houses were shut tight, and cloth wedged around doors and windows, but the dust came in so thinly that it could not be seen in the air, and it settled like pollen on the chairs and tables, on the dishes. The people brushed it from their shoulders. Little lines of dust lay at the door sills.

当夜幕再次降临，那是个黑沉沉的夜，星光无法穿透尘埃抵达地面，窗户里的灯光甚至照不出自家的院子。此时，尘土已与空气均匀混合，成了一种悬浮物。家家户户门窗紧闭，缝隙都用布条塞紧，但尘埃还是乘虚而入，细微得在空气中无法看见，却如花粉般洒落，在椅子上、桌子上、碗碟上，积了薄薄一层。人们不时掸去肩上的灰尘。门槛上，也积了一道细细的尘线。

In the middle of that night the wind passed on and left the land quiet. The dust-filled air muffled sound more completely than fog does. The people, lying in their beds, heard the wind stop. They awakened when the rushing wind was gone. They lay quietly and listened deep into the stillness. Then the roosters crowed, and their voices were muffled, and the people stirred restlessly in their beds and wanted the morning. They knew it would take a long time for the dust to settle out of the air. In the morning the dust hung like fog, and the sun was as red as ripe new blood. All day the dust sifted down from the sky, and the next day it sifted down. An even blanket covered the earth. It settled on the corn, piled up on the tops of the fence posts, piled up on the wires; it settled on roofs, blanketed the weeds and trees.

半夜，风过去了，留下一片寂静的土地。充满尘埃的空气比浓雾更能隔绝声音。躺在床上的人们听到了风停。呼啸的风声一消失，他们就醒了。他们静静地躺着，侧耳倾听这无边沉寂的深处。接着，公鸡开始打鸣，啼叫声也闷闷的。人们在床上辗转反侧，盼着天明。他们知道，要等空气里的尘土沉降下来，得花很长时间。清晨，尘土像浓雾一样悬浮着，太阳殷红如血。一整天，尘土从天上纷纷筛落，第二天，依旧筛落。一层均匀的尘毯覆盖了大地。它落在玉米上，堆在篱笆桩顶上，积在铁丝上；它落在屋顶上，覆盖了野草和树木。

The people came out of their houses and smelled the hot stinging air and covered their noses from it. And the children came out of the houses, but they did not run or shout as they would have done after a rain. Men stood by their fences and looked at the ruined corn, drying fast now, only a little green showing through the film of dust. The men were silent and they did not move often. And the women came out of the houses to stand beside their men—to feel whether this time the men would break. The women studied the men's faces secretly, for the corn could go, as long as something else remained. The children stood near by, drawing figures in the dust with bare toes, and the children sent exploring senses out to see whether men and women would break. The children peeked at the faces of the men and women, and then drew careful lines in the dust with their toes. Horses came to the watering troughs and nuzzled the water to clear the surface dust. After a while the faces of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became hard and angry and resistant. Then the women knew that they were safe and that there was no break. Then they asked, "What'll we do?" And the men replied, "I don't know." But it was all right. The women knew it was all right, and the watching children knew it was all right. Women and children knew deep in themselves that no misfortune was too great to bear if their men were whole. The women went into the houses to their work, and the children began to play, but cautiously at first. As the day went forward the sun became less red. It flared down on the dust-blanketed land. The men sat in the doorways of their houses; their hands were busy with sticks and little rocks. The men sat still—thinking—figuring.

人们走出屋子，闻到空气中灼热而刺鼻的味道，都捂住了鼻子。孩子们也走出屋子，却没有像雨后那样奔跑或喊叫。男人们站在篱笆边，望着毁掉的庄稼，那些玉米正迅速干枯，只有透过一层薄尘还能看到一丝绿色。男人们沉默着，不常走动。女人们也走出屋子，站到丈夫身边——想要探知这一次男人们是否会垮掉。女人们偷偷端详着男人的脸，因为庄稼可以毁了，只要还有别的东西在。孩子们站在近旁，用光脚趾在尘土里画着图案，他们也悄悄观察，想知道大人们会不会垮掉。孩子们偷觑着大人的脸，然后用脚趾在尘土里小心翼翼地画着线条。马匹来到饮水槽边，用鼻子拨开水面的浮尘。过了一会儿，男人们脸上困惑迷茫的神情消失了，取而代之的是坚毅、愤怒和倔强。这时，女人们知道她们安全了，男人们没有垮。于是她们问：“我们该怎么办？”男人们回答：“我不知道。”但一切都会没事的。女人们知道，在一旁观察的孩子们也知道。女人和孩子们的内心深处都明白，只要他们的男人精神不倒，就没有什么灾难是承受不了的。女人们走进屋里去做她们的活计，孩子们也开始玩耍，但起初很小心。随着白日推移，太阳的红色渐渐消退。它照耀着这片尘封之地。男人们坐在自家门口，手里摆弄着木棍和小石块。男人们静静地坐着——沉思着——盘算着。

## Synthesis

**En**
 The passage chronicles the devastating transformation of Oklahoma farmland from a verdant landscape to a dust-blanketed wasteland. It begins with the last gentle rains giving way to a relentless drought and scorching sun that withers the corn. A powerful wind then picks up, eroding the dry soil and creating a massive dust storm that darkens the sky, destroys the crops, and blankets everything in a thick layer of dust. In the aftermath, the narrative shifts to the human response. Families emerge to witness the ruin, and there is a tense moment as women and children watch the men, fearing they will break under the weight of the disaster. However, the men's initial confusion turns into hard-bitten resolve, signaling their refusal to be defeated. This display of resilience reassures their families that they can endure any misfortune, and the men begin to quietly plan for the future amidst the devastation.

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"The sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet."**

- 剖析：此句的理解难点在于其生动的比喻。“flared down” 意为“（像火焰般）熊熊照射下来”，精准地描绘了太阳的酷烈和灼热感。“green bayonet”（绿色的刺刀）是此句的核心比喻，将挺拔尖锐的玉米叶比作刺刀。这个比喻一语双关：既形象地描绘了玉米叶的外形，又暗示了玉米在烈日下挣扎求存，仿佛在与酷热进行一场无声的战斗。句末“a line of brown spread along theedge”则生动地展现了玉米叶因缺水而从边缘开始枯萎焦黄的过程，如同刺刀的锋刃开始生锈、卷曲，预示着生命的消逝和战斗的失败。

2. **"During a night the wind raced faster over the land, dug cunningly among the rootlets of the corn, and the corn fought the wind with its weakened leaves until the roots were freed by the prying wind and then each stalk settled wearily sideways toward the earth and pointed the direction of the wind."**

- 剖析：这是一个描绘玉米被风摧毁过程的超长复合句，其难点在于复杂的结构和贯穿始终的拟人化手法。句子通过一连串的动词展现了风与玉米的激烈对抗。首先，风被赋予了智慧和恶意：“dug cunningly”（狡猾地挖掘），描绘风力如何精准地侵蚀玉米根部的土壤。玉米则被赋予了抗争的意志：“fought the wind with its weakened leaves”（用衰弱的叶子与风搏斗）。接着，风再次被拟人化为“prying wind”（撬探的风），“prying”一词极具表现力，仿佛风像一个拿着撬棍的破坏者，将玉米的根从土里撬出。最后，玉米的死亡也被拟人化：“settled wearily sideways”（疲惫地歪倒），赋予了植被一种人的情感和姿态，令人心生怜悯。“pointed the direction of the wind”既是写实（倒下的玉米指向风向），也象征着风的彻底胜利。整个句子通过一场拟人化的史诗般战斗，将自然界的残酷描绘得淋漓尽致。

3. **"Now the dust was evenly mixed with the air, an emulsion of dust and air."**

- 剖析：这句话的精妙之处在于使用了一个不常见的科学术语“emulsion”（乳浊液）来进行比喻。“乳浊液”在化学中指一种液体以极微小的液滴均匀地分散在另一种不相溶的液体中，形成的稳定混合物（如牛奶、蛋黄酱）。斯坦贝克将这个词用于形容“尘土”和“空气”的混合，是一个极不寻常但异常精准的比喻。它不仅仅是说“空气中充满了灰尘”，而是强调了尘土微粒之细密、分布之均匀，已经和空气融为一体，形成了一种新的、稳定的、无法轻易分离的“介质”。这个比喻传达出一种令人窒息的、无处可逃的压迫感，暗示着环境已被彻底改变，生存变得极为艰难。

4. **"The women studied the men's faces secretly, for the corn could go, as long as something else remained."**

- 剖析：此句的难度在于其深刻的心理描写和抽象的表达。“the corn could go”代表物质财富的毁灭，这是可以接受的损失。“as long as something else remained”中的“something else”（别的东西）是理解的关键，它是一个抽象概念，并未明说。通过上下文可知，这“别的东西”指的是男人们的精神、意志和作为家庭支柱的坚韧。女人们秘密观察（studied...secretly）的动作，揭示了她们内心的极度焦虑与紧张，她们在评估的不是物质损失，而是家庭的精神核心是否会崩溃。这句话将叙事的重心从自然灾害转向了人性考验，揭示了在极端困境中，精神力量比物质财富更为重要。

5. **"After a while the faces of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became hard and angry and resistant."**

- 剖析：此句的难度在于其精准的心理转变描绘和层次丰富的词汇选择。“Bemused perplexity”是理解的第一个坎，“bemused”指“困惑的、茫然的”，“perplexity”指“迷惑、不知所措”。这个词组准确地捕捉了男人们在面对突如其来的、无法理解的巨大灾难时的初始状态——震惊、迷惘、无力。而随后的转变“became hard and angry and resistant”是全文的转折点。“Hard”（变得坚硬、冷峻）表明他们收起了脆弱和迷茫；“angry”（愤怒）表明他们内心的斗志被点燃，从被动的受害者转变为主动的反抗者；“resistant”（抵抗的、有韧性的）则宣告了他们绝不屈服的决心。这个从“茫然”到“抗争”的面部表情变化，是人物内心完成重塑的外在体现，标志着人性在灾难面前的胜利。

6. **"Women and children knew deep in themselves that no misfortune was too great to bear if their men were whole."**

- 剖析：此句的难度在于对抽象词“whole”（完整的）的理解。在这里，“whole”远超其字面意思。它并非指身体上的健全，而是指精神和意志上的“完整”。一个“whole”的男人，意味着他没有被灾难击垮，他的精神没有崩溃，他的决心依然坚定，他的家庭主心骨地位依然稳固。这句话是全文主旨的点睛之笔，它深刻地揭示了一个家庭（乃至一个社群）的生存哲学：只要作为核心的精神支柱不倒，任何物质上的不幸（no misfortune was too great to bear）都是可以承受和克服的。它强调了在逆境中，人的精神完整性和内在力量是决定存亡的最终因素。
