<center>Now That I'm Organized<center>
E.B. White



It will be a week come tomorrow that Miss Nulty looked up from her dictation and said: "You have no work-organizer on your desk, have you, Mr. White?"

算起来，到明天就整整一周了。那天，诺尔蒂小姐从听写的文稿上抬起头，对我说：“怀特先生，您桌上没有文件整理夹，对吧？”

Seven crowded days have intervened. I can hardly believe that at this time last week I did not even know what a work-organizer was.

这七天过得可真是纷乱。我简直不敢相信，就在上周的这个时候，我居然还不知道文件整理夹是何物。

"You see," said Miss Nulty, returning from the stock room with a package under her arm, "now instead of having your papers strewn all over your desk, you place them in this organizer under the proper headings, where you can always find them quick." Then, seeing my embarrassment, she considerately left the room, and I was alone with my work-organizer.

“您瞧，”诺尔蒂小姐说着，胳膊下夹着个包裹从储藏室回来，“这样一来，您的文件就不会在桌上摊得哪儿都是，而是可以分门别类地放进这个整理夹，贴上相应的标签，随时都能很快找到。”说完，她看到我一脸窘迫，便体贴地走出了房间，留下我独自面对我的文件整理夹。

I lit a cigarette. The new article was brown, and very cleverly constructed—a sort of flat paper file, with twelve flaps, each flap fitted with a small isinglass frame in which the person whose work was to be organized could insert a "heading" or "classification." It did not take me long to realize that the first step would be to organize the organizer.

我点上一支烟。这件新玩意儿是棕色的，做得十分精巧——像一个扁平的纸质文件夹，有十二个隔层，每层都带有一个透明的小框，方便整理文件的人插入“标题”或“分类”标签。我很快就意识到，第一步得先给这个整理夹本身进行一番整理。

Cutting the little strips of paper for the frames took quite a while and was light, pleasant work. Thinking up headings, however, did not come so easily. I decided to devote the first compartment to Beazley Hoke, to whom we sell most of our harness snaps, and with whom, for that reason, I have a great deal of correspondence. I lettered the name on one of the strips of paper and inserted it in the first frame. It showed up well, although my capital B was never anything to go around telling people about. The second flap I called "Letters to Answer."

为小框裁剪纸条花了不少时间，倒也轻松愉快。不过，想标题可就没那么容易了。我决定把第一个隔层分给比兹利·霍克，我们大部分的马具搭扣都卖给他，因此我和他书信往来颇多。我在一张纸条上工工整整地写下他的名字，塞进第一个框里。字迹很显眼，尽管我那个大写的B实在写得拿不出手。第二个隔层，我命名为“待复信件”。

Next it occurred to me that there should be one compartment in my organizer given over to matters that demanded immediate attention. I wrote out "Matters Demanding Immediate Attention"—but it was too long to fit the little isinglass frame, and didn't have quite the right sound anyway. I tried shortening it to "Immediate Attention Things" and then to "Right Away Papers," but neither of these seemed to have the authentic tone. By this time the strain of trying to invent headings was making me a little bit sick, and I had to leave my desk for a moment and get a drink of water. It worried me to be showing signs of nerves; here it was eleven o'clock, my desk piled high, and no work done. Still, I thought, once I get this organizer going I certainly will be able to tear through this stuff.

接着我想到，整理夹里应该有一个隔层专门用来放需要立即处理的事情。我写下了“需立即处理事宜”——但这几个字太长了，塞不进那个透明小框，而且听起来也不太对劲。我试着缩短为“急着办的事”，又改成“马上就办的文件”，但都觉得不够地道。这会儿，绞尽脑汁想标题的压力让我有点心烦意乱，我不得不离开办公桌去喝杯水。十一点了，桌上文件堆积如山，工作却一点没做，这让我开始有了焦虑的迹象。不过，我心想，一旦把这个整理夹弄好了，我肯定能把这些东西一扫而空。

When I returned from the water-cooler I settled on the word "Quick" as the best heading for the third compartment. Just before inserting it, another thought came to me, and I took my pen and added an exclamation point, making it "Quick!" It looked fine.

从饮水机旁回来，我最终选定了“加急”这个词作为第三个隔层的标题。就在我准备把它插进去之前，我又冒出一个念头，于是拿起笔添上了一个感叹号，变成了“加急！”。看起来棒极了。

Before another hour was over I had reserved a compartment for Mr. Higgins, one for “Unimportant,” one for “To Think About,” one called "Yes or No?" (in which I decided to put matters which might come to me for my opinion, although there are not many of these), and then I remembered that after all it was Miss Nulty who had got the work-organizer for me, and the least I could do to show my appreciation would be to name one of the compartments for her.

不到一个小时，我又预留出一个隔层给希金斯先生，一个给“不重要”，一个给“待思考”，还有一个叫“待定夺？”（我决定把那些可能征求我意见的事情放进去，虽然这种事不多）。然后我记起来，这整理夹毕竟是诺尔蒂小姐给我拿的，我至少该用一个隔层以她的名字命名，聊表谢意。

I called the ninth “Personal,” the tenth “Loose Papers,” and then, with two compartments still unnamed, my imagination refused to budge. This bothered me, for I decided that there would be no vacant compartments in a desk file of mine. For a time I didn't know but that I would have to close my desk and go home and lie down there for a while.

我把第九个命名为“私人”，第十个是“零散文件”，这时还剩下两个隔层没起名，我的想象力却罢工了。这让我很苦恼，因为我打定主意，我的文件整理夹里一个空格都不能有。有一阵子，我甚至以为自己非得合上办公桌，回家躺会儿不可了。

Finally, despairing, I named one of the flaps "Cigarette Coupons" and destroyed the twelfth (and last) one by ripping out the flap and throwing it away.

最终，在绝望之下，我把其中一个隔层命名为“香烟赠券”，然后把第十二个（也是最后一个）隔层撕掉毁了。

It was now past one o'clock, and I went to lunch.

这会儿已经一点多了，我便去吃午饭。

How clearly the events of that day stand out in my memory! I recall perfectly picking up the menu at the restaurant and seeing, instead of items of food, a bill which read like this:

那天发生的事，我至今记忆犹新！我清楚地记得，在餐厅拿起菜单，看到的却不是菜名，而是一张账单般的列表：

BEAZLEY HOKE
LETTERS TO ANSWER
QUICK!
MR. HIGGINS
UNIMPORTANT
TO THINK ABOUT
YES OR NO?
MISS NULTY
PERSONAL
LOOSE PAPERS
CIGARETTE COUPONS

比兹利·霍克
待复信件
加急！
希金斯先生
不重要
待思考
待定夺？
诺尔蒂小姐
私人
零散文件
香烟赠券

“Beef stew,” I told the waiter—but I could do no more than pick at it. On my way back to the office I bought a pack of cigarettes. A few moments later, when I thought no one was looking, I slid the coupons in the right compartment and felt a whole lot of relief at having taken the first step toward filling up the organizer. Still, even with that as a starter, the task proved to be only in its infancy.

“一份炖牛肉，”我告诉服务员——但我却只是胡乱拨弄了几下，根本吃不下去。回办公室的路上，我买了一包香烟。稍后，趁没人注意，我把赠券塞进了对应的隔层，为填满整理夹迈出了这第一步而感到如释重负。然而，即便开了这个头，这项任务也才刚刚起步。

All afternoon things got steadily worse. Almost every paper on my desk seemed to admit of more than one classification, and I have never been able to make quick decisions. Here, for example, was a letter from Mr. Hoke. First I pushed it tentatively under "Beazley Hoke," only to withdraw it hurriedly and put it under "Letters to Answer." There again I wasn't sure of myself. I remembered that it was probably a pretty urgent letter and therefore should be under "Quick!" I made that change. Unfortunately, in filing it, I happened to glance at it and saw how very urgent it really was. It was so urgent that it should have been acknowledged by phone at ten o'clock in the morning, and here it was three in the afternoon and the letter just being filed under "Quick!" Heaven knew when I would get round to looking under "Quick!" For an instant I wavered and was tempted to tend to the letter directly; but I knew how fatal to any work-organizer system it would be were I to start acting that way. I was thoroughly frightened, now. It was no longer possible for me to remain seated; the phone rang intermittently, the distribution boy appeared at intervals with new memoranda and letters, and I saw only too clearly that I was not even holding my own—the desk was littered worse than when I started. In my panicky condition I went about picking up pieces of paper, with a vague, garbled expression on my face—picking them up, laying them down again, and all the while walking slowly round and round my desk. I was ten minutes trying to decide whether to put a circular letter from my university's endowment fund under "Unimportant" or "To Think About." That's how bad I was. At four o'clock, echoes from my inactive, distraught state began to be heard. The first was an inquiry from the office of our first vice-president, wanting to know why I hadn't sent a confirmation of Beazley Hoke's order of even date for five thousand harness snaps. After twenty minutes' frantic search I found the order under "Loose Papers," refiled it under "Quick!" and sent back a memorandum to the vice-president, saying: "Everything in good time."

整个下午，情况越来越糟。我桌上几乎每份文件似乎都可以归入不止一类，而我又向来不善于当机立断。比如，这封霍克先生的来信。我先是试探性地把它塞进“比兹利·霍克”一栏，随即又急忙抽出来，放进“待复信件”。可我又拿不准了。我记得这封信大概挺紧急，所以应该放在“加急！”里。我便又换了地方。不幸的是，归档时我无意中瞥了一眼信的内容，才发现它到底有多紧急。这封信紧急到我本该在早上十点就电话确认，可现在都下午三点了，它才刚刚被归入“加急！”一栏。天晓得我什么时候才会去看“加急！”那一栏！有一瞬间，我动摇了，很想直接处理这封信；但我知道，如果我真那么做了，对任何文件整理系统而言都将是致命的。这下我彻底吓坏了。我再也坐不住了；电话不时响起，分发文件的勤杂员隔三差五送来新的备忘录和信件，我看得太清楚了，自己连原地踏步都做不到了——办公桌比我开始整理时更乱了。我惊慌失措，脸上带着茫然而困惑的表情，捡起一张张纸，又放下，同时绕着桌子一圈又一圈地踱步。为了一封大学捐赠基金会的募捐通知函，我花了十分钟来决定是该把它归入“不重要”还是“待思考”。我就糟糕到了这个地步。到了四点钟，我这种不作为的抓狂状态终于引来了连锁反应。第一个来自我们第一副总的办公室，质问我为何没有确认比兹利·霍克当天那张五千个马具搭扣的订单。我手忙脚乱地找了二十分钟，才在“零散文件”里找到订单，将它重新归入“加急！”，然后给副总回了张便条，写着：“凡事都得按部就班来。”

When the news of the second echo arrived, I was in the reception-room, lying on the couch, the blood pumping in my head. Miss Nulty brought me the tidings. It seems that in one of the letters on my desk there had been a P.S., stating that Mr. Beazley himself would be in New York on Thursday, and would our Mr. Higgins care to see him for lunch and possibly for a little golf? "Don't you know that is very important?" asked Miss Nulty, trying to speak gently.

第二个连锁反应的消息传来时，我正躺在接待室的沙发上，只觉得血往上涌。是诺尔蒂小姐给我带来了消息。原来，我桌上的一封信里有一句附言，说比兹利先生本人周四会来纽约，问我们的希金斯先生是否有兴趣与他共进午餐，或许还能打一场高尔夫？“您难道不知道这事很重要吗？”诺尔蒂小姐问，尽量用温和的语气说。

"Yes," I replied, wearily, "where did you find it?"

“知道，”我疲惫地答道，“你在哪儿找到的？”

"In the bottom of your work-organizer," she replied, "in amongst a couple of cigarette coupons!"

“在您文件整理夹的最底层，”她回答，“混在一堆香烟赠券里！”

Well, as I say, seven crowded days have intervened since I got my work-organizer. On the whole it has been a happy period. Things have gradually smoothed out, and I am glad to say that it still takes me the entire day, from nine to five, to organize my work, with the gratifying result that I never have to do any.

总之，就像我说的，自从有了文件整理夹，纷乱的七日已经过去。总的来说，这是一段快乐的时光。事情已逐渐理顺，我很高兴地告诉各位，我依然要花上从早九点到晚五点一整天的时间来整理我的工作，而令人欣慰的是，结果我什么工作都不用做了。

## Synthesis

**En**
The story satirizes the pitfalls of procrastination and the illusion of productivity. The narrator, a self-proclaimed disorganized person, is given a "work-organizer" by a well-meaning colleague to help him manage his messy desk. Instead of using the tool to accomplish his tasks, he becomes obsessively consumed with the preliminary step of creating the perfect classification system for it. This process, filled with indecision and anxiety, takes up his entire day. His fixation on "organizing" leads to him misfiling urgent documents and missing important client meetings, causing professional chaos. The story culminates in the narrator's ironic conclusion: he has successfully developed a system where he spends all his time organizing, with the "gratifying result" that he never has to do any actual work, thus turning a tool for efficiency into the ultimate instrument of avoidance.

**Zh**
这篇故事讽刺了拖延症的陷阱以及“看似高效”的假象。叙述者自认是一个杂乱无章的人，一位好心的同事给了他一个“工作整理夹”来帮助他管理凌乱的桌面。然而，他并没有利用这个工具来完成工作，反而陷入了为整理夹创建完美分类标签的准备工作中，无法自拔。这个充满犹豫和焦虑的过程耗费了他一整天的时间。他对“整理”的执念导致他错误归档了紧急文件、错过了重要的客户会议，引发了工作上的混乱。故事在叙述者充满反讽的结论中达到高潮：他成功地建立了一个体系，让他可以花所有时间来整理，其“喜人的结果”便是他再也无需做任何实际工作了——一个本应提高效率的工具，最终沦为了逃避工作的终极手段。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"It will be a week come tomorrow that Miss Nulty looked up from her dictation and said..."**
- 剖析： 这句话的难点在于其不常见的时态表达方式“come tomorrow”。这里的“come tomorrow”相当于“when tomorrow comes”（当明天到来时）。整个句子的意思是：“到明天，距离诺尔蒂小姐从听写中抬起头说那句话，就整整一周了。” 它建立了一个追溯性的时间框架，暗示接下来的叙述是关于过去这“拥挤的七天”里发生的事情。这种略带古雅的表达方式为故事增添了一种娓娓道来的叙事口吻。

2. **"my capital B was never anything to go around telling people about."**
- 剖析： 此句是一个典型的英式低调陈述（understatement）和习惯用语。“be nothing to tell people about” 或 “be nothing to write home about” 是一个固定短语，意为“没什么值得炫耀的”、“不怎么样”或“很一般”。作者在这里用一种自嘲的口吻说，他写的大写字母“B”实在拿不出手。这句话不仅刻画了叙述者谦虚甚至有点缺乏自信的性格，也通过对这种微不足道的细节的关注，暗示了他接下来将陷入对“整理”细节的过度纠结中。

3. **"Almost every paper on my desk seemed to admit of more than one classification, and I have never been able to make quick decisions."**
- 剖析： 此句的理解难点在于短语“admit of”。在这里，“admit of”并不是“承认”，而是“容许有”、“有…的可能性”或“留有…的余地”。因此，这句话的意思是：“我桌上的几乎每一份文件似乎都容许不止一种分类方法”。这个短语揭示了叙述者拖延和瘫痪的根本原因：并非文件本身复杂，而是他的思维方式让他看到了过多的可能性，再加上他“向来无法快速做决定”的性格，两者结合，使得本应简单的分类工作变得无比困难。

4. **"but I knew how fatal to any work-organizer system it would be were I to start acting that way."**
- 剖析： 这是一个使用了虚拟语气和倒装的复杂句，理解难度较高。正常语序应为：“...it would be fatal... if I were to start acting that way.”。这里将“were”提前，构成了“were + 主语 + to do”的倒装结构，用于表示与将来事实相反的假设，语气比普通的“if”条件句更正式、更强烈。整句话的意思是：“但我深知，如果我真的开始那样做（指直接处理信件而不先归档），那对于任何一个工作整理系统都将是致命的打击。” 这句话极具讽刺意味，显示出叙述者已经本末倒置：他把维护“系统”的完整性看得比完成实际工作更加重要，揭示了他陷入程序主义的荒谬心态。

5. **"The first was an inquiry from the office of our first vice-president, wanting to know why I hadn't sent a confirmation of Beazley Hoke's order of even date for five thousand harness snaps."**
- 剖析： 此句的难点在于商业术语“of even date”。这是一个相对正式且有些过时的法律或商业用语，意思是“同一日期的”或“当日的”。它指代的是前文提到的那封霍克先生的信件。因此，整句话的意思是：“第一个坏消息是来自我们第一副总裁办公室的质询，他想知道为什么我没有就比亚兹利·霍克先生今日订单中的五千个马具搭扣发送确认函。” 这个正式而严肃的用语，与叙述者当时手忙脚乱、精神错乱的状态形成了鲜明的对比，凸显了事态的严重性和他所造成混乱的真实后果。

6. **"Things have gradually smoothed out, and I am glad to say that it still takes me the entire day, from nine to five, to organize my work, with the gratifying result that I never have to do any."**
- 剖析： 这是全文的点睛之笔，充满了反讽（irony）。从字面上看，“smoothed out”（事情理顺了）、“glad to say”（很高兴地说）和“gratifying result”（令人满意的结果）都是积极的表述。然而，其真正的含义完全相反。作者讽刺地表示，他所谓的“理顺”就是找到了一个完美的借口——他现在每天从早到晚都只做“整理”这一件事，其“令人满意的结果”就是他成功地逃避了所有实际需要完成的工作。这句话揭示了故事的核心主题：一个旨在提高效率的工具，在拖延者手中，反而可以被扭曲成一个完美消耗时间、逃避责任的屏障。效率工具的最终“成果”是零效率，这正是文章最大的讽刺所在。
