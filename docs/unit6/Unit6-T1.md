A great many people have come up to me and asked me how I manage to get so much work done and still keep looking so dissipated. My answer is "Don't you wish you knew?" and a pretty good answer it is, too, when you consider that nine times out of ten I didn't hear the original question.

许多人曾走上前来问我，是如何做到既能完成浩如烟海的工作，又能总是一副神情萎靡的模样。我的回答是：“你倒是想知道吧？”这回答妙极了，你要知道，十有八九我根本没听清人家问的是什么。

But the fact remains that hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country are wondering how I have time to do all my painting, engineering, writing and philanthropic work when, according to the rotogravure sections and society notes, I spend all my time riding to hounds, going to fancy-dress balls disguised as Louis XIV or spelling out GREETINGS TO CALIFORNIA in formation with three thousand Los Angeles school children. "All work and all play," they say.

但事实是，全国成千上万的人都在好奇，我究竟哪来的时间去搞我的绘画、工程、写作和慈善事业，因为根据报纸的画刊和社交版的报道，我的全部时间都花在骑马猎狐、化装成路易十四参加假面舞会，或是与三千名洛杉矶学童一同列队拼出“加州欢迎你”的字样上。他们说：“真是工作娱乐两不误啊。”

The secret of my incredible energy and efficiency in getting work done is a simple one. I have based it very deliberately on a well-known psychological principle and have refined it so that it is now almost too refined. I shall have to begin coarsening it up again pretty soon.

我能以惊人的精力和效率完成工作的秘诀其实很简单。我刻意将它建立在一个众所周知的心理学原理之上，并对其精雕细琢，以至于如今近乎登峰造极。恐怕很快我就得让它返璞归真，改得粗糙一点了。

The psychological principle is this: anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment.

这个心理学原理便是：任何人都能完成任何量的工作，只要那不是他此刻分内之事。

Let us see how this works out in practice. Let us say that I have five things which have to be done before the end of the week: (1) a basketful of letters to be answered, some of them dating from October, 1928, (2) some bookshelves to be put up and arranged with books, (3) a hair-cut to get, (4) a pile of scientific magazines to go through and clip (I am collecting all references to tropical fish that I can find, with the idea of some day buying myself one), and (5) an article to write for this paper.

让我们看看这在实践中是如何运作的。比方说，这周结束前我有五件事必须完成：（1）回一大筐信，其中一些的日期还是1928年10月；（2）搭几个书架并把书摆好；（3）理个发；（4）翻完一摞科学杂志并剪下需要的部分（我正在收集所有能找到的关于热带鱼的资料，想着哪天给自己买一条）；以及（5）为这家报纸写一篇文章。

Now. With these five tasks staring me in the face on Monday morning, it is little wonder that I go right back to bed as soon as I have had breakfast, in order to store up health and strength for the almost superhuman expenditure of energy that is to come. 'Mens sana in corpore sano' is my motto, and, not even to be funny, am I going to make believe that I don't know what the Latin means. I feel that the least that I can do is to treat my body right when it has to supply fuel for an insatiable mind like mine.

好了。周一早上，这五项任务摆在眼前，亟待处理，难怪我用完早餐就立刻回床上躺着了，为的是给即将到来的、近乎超人般的精力消耗养精蓄锐。“健全的精神寓于健康的身体”是我的座右铭，而且我可不会假装不知道这句拉丁文的意思，这并非玩笑。我觉得，我的身体要为我这样一颗永不满足的头脑提供燃料，我起码能做的，就是善待它。

As I lie in bed on Monday morning storing up strength, I make out a schedule. "What do I have to do first?" I ask myself. Well, those letters really should be answered and the pile of scientific magazines should be clipped. And here is where my secret process comes in. Instead of putting them first on the list of things which have to be done, I put them last. I practice a little deception on myself and say, "First you must write that article for the newspaper." I even say this out loud (being careful that nobody hears me, otherwise they would keep me in bed) and try to fool myself into really believing that I must do the article that day and that the other things can wait. I sometimes go so far in this self-deception as to make out a list in pencil, with "No. 1. Newspaper article" underlined in red. (The underlining in red is rather difficult, as there is never a red pencil on the table beside the bed, unless I have taken one to bed with me on Sunday night.)

周一早上，我躺在床上养精蓄锐，同时制定了一份日程表。“我该先做什么？”我问自己。嗯，那些信件确实该回了，那堆科学杂志也该剪报了。我的秘诀就从这里开始大显神通了。我没有把它们列在待办事项清单的首位，而是放在了最后。我对自己耍了个小花招，说：“你必须先写报社那篇文章。”我甚至会把这句话大声说出来（同时小心翼翼不让别人听见，否则他们会把我按在床上的），并努力欺骗自己，让自己真切地相信我当天必须完成这篇文章，其他事情都可以缓缓。有时，为了自欺欺人，我甚至会用铅笔列个清单，在“第一项：报纸文章”下面用红笔划上横线。（用红笔划线这事儿可不太容易，因为床头柜上从来没有红铅笔，除非我周日晚上就特意带一支上床。）

Then, when everything is lined up, I bound out of bed and have lunch. I find that a good, heavy lunch, with some sort of glutinous dessert, is good preparation for the day's work as it keeps one from getting nervous and excitable. We workers must keep cool and calm, otherwise we would just throw away our time in jumping about and fidgeting.

然后，一切就绪，我一跃下床，去吃午饭。我发现，一顿丰盛的午餐，再配上某种黏糊糊的甜点，是为一天工作做的极佳准备，因为它能让人免于紧张激动。我们这些劳动者必须保持冷静沉着，否则只会把时间浪费在上蹿下跳和坐立不安上。

I then seat myself at my desk with my typewriter before me, and sharpen five pencils. (The sharp pencils are for poking holes in the desk-blotter, and a pencil has to be pretty sharp to do that. I find that I can't get more than six holes out of one pencil.) Following this I say to myself (again out loud, if it is practical), "Now, old man! Get at this article!"

接着，我坐在书桌前，面前摆着打字机，削好五支铅笔。（削尖的铅笔是用来在桌上的吸墨纸上戳洞玩的，要干这个，铅笔必须相当尖。我发现一支铅笔最多也就能戳六个洞。）之后，我对（如果方便的话，还是大声地）对自己说：“好了，老伙计！开始写稿吧！”

Gradually the scheme begins to work. My eye catches the pile of magazines, which I have artfully placed on a nearby table beforehand. I write my name and address at the top of the sheet of paper in the typewriter and then sink back. The magazines being within reach (also part of the plot), I look to see if anyone is watching me and get one off the top of the pile. Hello, what's this! In the very first one is an article by Dr. William Beebe, illustrated by horrifying photographs! Pushing my chair away from my desk, I am soon hard at work clipping.

渐渐地，这个计策开始奏效了。我的目光落在了那堆杂志上，这是我事先巧妙安排在旁边桌上的。我在打字机的稿纸顶端打上自己的姓名和地址，然后往椅背上一靠。杂志触手可及（这也是计谋的一部分），我环顾四周，看看是否有人在监视我，然后从那摞杂志顶上抽出一本。嘿，这是什么！第一本里就是威廉·毕比博士的文章，还配着吓人的照片！我把椅子从书桌前推开，很快就埋头做起了剪报。

One of the interesting things about the Argyropelecus, or "Silver Hatchet" fish, I find, is that it has eyes in its wrists. I would have been sufficiently surprised just to find out that a fish had wrists, but to learn that it has eyes in them is a discovery so astounding that I am hardly able to cut out the picture. What a lot one learns simply by thumbing through the illustrated weeklies! It is hard work, though, and many a weaker spirit would give it up half-done, but when there is something else of "more importance" to be finished (you see, I still keep up the deception, letting myself go on thinking that the newspaper article is of more importance) no work is too hard or too onerous to keep one busy. Thus, before the afternoon is half over, I have gone through the scientific magazines and have a neat pile of clippings (including one of a Viper Fish which I wish you could see. You would die laughing). Then it is back to the grind of the newspaper article.

我发现，关于银斧鱼（Argyropelecus）的一个有趣之处在于，它的眼睛长在手腕上。光是发现鱼有手腕就够我吃惊的了，更别提手腕上还长着眼睛，这一发现实在惊世骇俗，让我差点连图片都剪不下来。随便翻翻这些画报周刊，就能学到多少东西啊！不过，这可是个苦差事，许多意志薄弱的人恐怕早已半途而废了，可一旦有“更重要”的事（你瞧，我还在继续自欺欺人，让自己以为写稿才是头等大事）等着去完成，那就没有什么工作是太辛苦或太繁重的了，总能让你忙得不亦乐乎。于是，不到半个下午，我就翻完了所有科学杂志，得到了一摞整齐的剪报（其中一张是蝰鱼，真希望你能看看，保管你笑死）。然后，又该回去啃写稿这块硬骨头了。

This time I get as far as the title, which I write down with considerable satisfaction until I find that I have misspelled one word terribly, so that the whole sheet of paper has to come out and a fresh one be inserted. As I am doing this, my eye catches the basket of letters.

这次，我进展到了写标题。我心满意足地写下标题，却发现有个词拼错了，错得离谱，只好把整张纸取出来，换上一张新的。就在这时，我的目光落在了那个信筐上。

Now, if there is one thing that I hate to do (and there is, you may be sure) it is to write letters. But somehow, with the magazine article before me waiting to be done, I am seized with an epistolary fervor that amounts to a craving, and I slyly sneak the first of the unanswered letters out of the basket. I figure out in my mind that I will get more into the swing of writing the article if I practice a little on a few letters. This first one, anyway, I really must answer. True, it is from a friend in Antwerp asking me to look him up when I am in Europe in the summer of 1929, so he can't actually be watching the incoming boats for an answer, but I owe something to politeness after all. So instead of putting a fresh sheet of copy-paper into the typewriter, I slip in one of my handsome bits of personal stationery and dash off a note to my friend in Antwerp. Then, being well in the letter-writing mood, I clean up the entire batch. I feel a little guilty about the article, but the pile of freshly stamped envelopes and the neat bundle of clippings on tropical fish do much to salve my conscience. Tomorrow I will do the article, and no fooling this time, either.

要说我有什么事是深恶痛绝的（你尽管放心，肯定有），那就是写信。但不知为何，眼看那篇稿子摆在面前等着动笔，我竟涌起一股写信的热情，几近成瘾，于是偷偷地从信筐里抽出第一封未回的信。我心里盘算着，先练练手写几封信，这样写起稿子来会更顺畅。不管怎么说，这第一封信我非回不可。没错，这信是安特卫普的一位朋友寄来的，请我1929年夏天去欧洲时找他玩，所以他眼下肯定不会正守着码头等回信，但我终究欠人家一份礼数。于是，我没有把新的稿纸塞进打字机，而是换上了一张我精美的私人信笺，飞快地给安特卫普的朋友写了张便条。接着，趁着写信的兴头正浓，我把所有信件都处理完了。虽然对那篇稿子有点内疚，但那堆贴好邮票的信封和那捆整齐的热带鱼剪报，大大地慰藉了我的良心。明天，明天我一定写稿，绝不含糊。

When tomorrow comes I am up with one of the older and more sluggish larks. A fresh sheet of copy-paper in the machine, and my name and address neatly printed at the top, and all before eleven A.M.! "A human dynamo" is the name I think up for myself. I have decided to write something about snake-charming and am already more than satisfied with the title "These Snake-Charming People." But, in order to write about snake-charming, one has to know a little about its history, and where should one go to find history but to a book? Maybe in that pile of books in the corner is one on snake-charming! Nobody could point the finger of scorn at me if I went over to those books for the avowed purpose of research work for the matter at hand. No writer could be supposed to carry all that information in his head.

第二天来了，我起得不算太早，算是跟着一只年迈迟缓的云雀一道起身吧。新稿纸已放入机器，姓名地址也已整齐地打在顶端，而这一切都在上午十一点前完成了！“人间发电机”，我为自己想出了这个称号。我决定写点关于耍蛇术的东西，而且对“耍蛇那伙人”这个标题已经满意得不得了。但是，要写耍蛇术，总得对它的历史有所了解，而要了解历史，除了求助于书本，还能去哪儿呢？没准墙角那堆书里就有一本讲耍蛇的！如果我为了手头的工作去做资料研究而翻看那些书，谁也不能因此对我指指点点。总不能指望一个作家把所有信息都记在脑子里吧。

So, with a perfectly clear conscience, I leave my desk for a few minutes and begin glancing over the titles of the books. Of course, it is difficult to find any book, much less one on snake-charming, in a pile which has been standing in the corner for weeks. What really is needed is for them to be on a shelf where their titles will be visible at a glance. And there is the shelf, standing beside the pile of books! It seems almost like a divine command written in the sky: "If you want to finish that article, first put up the shelf and arrange the books on it!" Nothing could be clearer or more logical.

于是，我心安理得地离开书桌几分钟，开始浏览书名。当然，在一堆已经在墙角放了好几个星期的书里，想找任何一本书都很难，更别说关于耍蛇术的了。真正需要的是把它们放到书架上，这样书名才能一目了然。而书架就在那儿，立在书堆旁边！这简直像天意昭然若揭：“要想写完那篇文章，就先把书架搭好，把书放上去！”再没有比这更清晰、更合逻辑的了。

In order to put up the shelf, the laws of physics have decreed that there must be nails, a hammer and some sort of brackets to hold it up on the wall. You can't just wet a shelf with your tongue and stick it up. And, as there are no nails or brackets in the house (or, if there are, they are probably hidden somewhere) the next thing to do is put on my hat and go out to buy them. Much as it disturbs me to put off the actual start of the article, I feel that I am doing only what is in the line of duty to put on my hat and go out to buy nails and brackets. And, as I put on my hat, I realize to my chagrin that I need a hair-cut badly. I can kill two birds with one stone, or at least with two, and stop in at the barber's on the way back. I will feel all the more like writing after a turn in the fresh air. Any doctor would tell me that.

根据物理定律，要搭好书架，就必须有钉子、锤子和某种能把它固定在墙上的托架。你总不能用舌头舔湿了书架就把它粘上去吧。而家里又没有钉子和托架（就算有，也可能藏在什么地方了），所以接下来要做的就是戴上帽子出门去买。尽管推迟动笔写稿让我心烦，但我感到，戴上帽子出门买钉子和托架，正是我分内之事。而戴上帽子时，我懊恼地意识到我急需理发。我可以一石二鸟，或者说，用两块石头打两只鸟，回来的路上去理发店待一会。出门呼吸一下新鲜空气，我会更有写作的欲望。任何医生都会这么告诉我。

So in a few hours I return, spick and span and smelling of lilac, bearing nails, brackets, the evening papers and some crackers and peanut butter. Then it's ho! for a quick snack and a glance through the evening papers (there might be something in them which would alter what I was going to write about snake-charming), and in no time at all the shelf is up, slightly crooked but up, and the books are arranged in a neat row, in alphabetical order, and all ready for almost instantaneous reference. There does not happen to be one on snake-charming among them, but there is a very interesting one containing some Hogarth prints and one which will bear even closer inspection dealing with the growth of the Motion Picture, illustrated with "stills" from famous productions. A really remarkable industry, the motion pictures. I might want to write an article on it sometime. Not today, probably, for it is six o'clock and there is still the one on snake-charming to finish up first. Tomorrow morning sharp! Yes, sir!

于是，几小时后我回来了，焕然一新，还带着丁香花的气味，手里提着钉子、托架、晚报，还有一些饼干和花生酱。嚯！先来点快餐，顺便浏览一下晚报（没准上面有什么新闻会改变我关于耍蛇术的写作计划），不一会儿，书架就搭好了，有点歪，但好歹是装上去了。书也按字母顺序整齐地排成一列，随时可供查阅。书里恰好没有一本是关于耍蛇术的，但有一本很有趣，收录了一些霍加斯的版画，还有一本更值得细看，是讲电影产业发展的，配有著名影片的剧照。电影，真是个了不起的产业。也许哪天我会想写一篇关于它的文章。但大概不是今天，因为已经六点了，那篇关于耍蛇术的稿子还得先完成呢。明天一早！准时开工！

And so, you see, in two days I have done four of the things I had to do, simply by making believe that it was the fifth that I must do. And the next day, I fix up something else, like taking down the bookshelf and putting it somewhere else, that I have to do, and then I get the fifth one done.

所以，你看，两天之内，我只靠假装必须完成第五件事，就做完了其余四件。到了第二天，我再安排一件别的事情，比如把书架拆下来再装到别处去，然后我就能把第五件事也做完了。

The only trouble is that, at this rate, I will soon run out of things to do, and will be forced to get at that newspaper article the first thing Monday morning.

唯一的问题是，照这个速度下去，我很快就无事可做了，到时就只能在周一早上第一件事就动笔写那篇稿子了。

——选自J. W. 普雷斯利与N. 普林斯基编著，第261-265页 **En**
 The author humorously debunks the myth of his own extraordinary productivity by revealing his secret "psychological principle": one can accomplish any amount of work, as long as it's not the work one is currently supposed to be doing. He illustrates this with a detailed, comical narrative where, tasked with writing a newspaper article, he successfully completes four other long-neglected chores—from answering years-old mail to building a bookshelf—precisely because they serve as an elaborate means of avoiding his primary, assigned task. The essay is a satirical ode to creative procrastination, portraying it as a perversely effective, if indirect, way of getting things done.

 本文以幽默诙谐的笔触，揭示了作者高效完成工作的“秘诀”。他戏称自己的高产并非源于自律，而是基于一个心理学原理：人可以完成任何数量的工作，只要那不是他当下理应完成的工作。作者通过一个生动的例子来阐释该原理：当他必须写一篇文章时，他反而以惊人的热情完成了四件被长期搁置的杂务——从回复积压多年的信件到安装书架——因为这些杂务恰恰是他逃避写文章这一首要任务的绝佳借口。全文通过对“创造性拖延”的讽刺性描绘，揭示了拖延症患者如何以一种兜圈子的、歪打正着的方式完成任务的心理状态。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"But the fact remains that hundreds of thousands of people throughout the country are wondering how I have time to do all my painting, engineering, writing and philanthropic work when, according to the rotogravure sections and society notes, I spend all my time riding to hounds, going to fancy-dress balls disguised as Louis XIV or spelling out GREETINGS TO CALIFORNIA in formation with three thousand Los Angeles school children."**

- 剖析： 这是一个典型的超长句，通过一个“when”引导的状语从句制造出强烈的反差和幽默效果。
- **主干结构**：“the fact remains that... people... are wondering how I have time to do... work”。意思是“事实是，人们都在好奇我哪来的时间做完那些工作”。
- **从句部分**：“when..., I spend all my time riding to hounds...”。这部分描述了“根据报纸画刊和社交版新闻”，作者把所有时间都花在了各种奢华的娱乐活动上。
- **难点解析**：“rotogravure sections and society notes”指报纸上刊登照片和上流社会新闻的版面。“riding to hounds”是骑马猎狐的贵族活动。“disguised as Louis XIV”指化装成法国国王路易十四参加化装舞会。最后“spelling out GREETINGS TO CALIFORNIA in formation with three thousand Los Angeles school children”更是极尽夸张之能事，想象自己与三千名小学生一同列队拼出欢迎字样。
- **句子主旨**：作者通过将自己“高产的工作”（绘画、工程、写作、慈善）与报纸上描写的“极其耗时的玩乐”并列，营造出一种荒诞的、不可能的形象。这种强烈的矛盾感，旨在用夸张的手法引出下文对自己所谓“高效率”的真实解释，充满自嘲和讽刺意味。

2. **"The psychological principle is this: anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment."**

- 剖析： 这句话是理解全文核心思想的关键，结构简单但概念抽象，具有悖论性质。
- **结构分析**：这是一个主系表结构的句子，冒号后面的内容是对主语“The psychological principle”（心理学原理）的解释。
- **核心概念**：“provided it isn't the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment”是一个条件状语从句，意思是“只要那不是他此刻被规定要干的工作”。
- **深层含义**：这句话揭示了拖延症的核心心理。人们的动力并非源于任务本身，而是源于对“规定义务”的抗拒。当一项任务成为“必须完成”的压力时，任何其他不相干的、甚至平时讨厌的任务，都会立刻变得极具吸引力，因为它们成了逃避“规定义务”的避难所。作者将这种普遍的拖延心理包装成一个听起来很专业的“心理学原理”，是本文幽默感的基石。

3. **"'Mens sana in corpore sano' is my motto, and, not even to be funny, am I going to make believe that I don't know what the Latin means."**

- 剖析： 此句结合了引用的外语、否定词前置的倒装以及双重否定，展现了作者独特的幽默风格。
- **“Mens sana in corpore sano”**：这是一句拉丁语格言，意为“健全的精神寓于健康的身体”。作者引用这句格言，是为自己吃完早饭就立刻回去睡觉的行为寻找一个冠冕堂皇的借口。
- **倒装结构**：“not even to be funny, am I going to make believe...”是典型的否定词/状语前置引起的半倒装结构，正常语序是“I am not going to make believe... even to be funny”。这种倒装加强了语气，显得更为郑重其事。
- **双重否定**：“make believe that I don't know”字面意思是“假装我不知道”。整个后半句“not... going to make believe that I don't know”的意思就是“我不会假装我不知道（这句拉丁语的意思）”，反过来就是“我非常清楚它的意思”。
- **句子主旨**：作者用一本正经的语气强调自己知道这句拉丁文的意思，这种此地无银三百两的辩解，恰恰反衬出他用这句格言来掩饰自己懒惰和拖延的滑稽用心，充满了智慧的自嘲。

4. **"But somehow, with the magazine article before me waiting to be done, I am seized with an epistolary fervor that amounts to a craving, and I slyly sneak the first of the unanswered letters out of the basket."**

- 剖析： 此句使用了生僻的词汇和生动的比喻来描绘拖延症发作时的心理状态。
- **“with the magazine article before me waiting to be done”**：这是一个with复合结构作状语，生动地描绘了“那篇必须写的文章就摆在眼前等着我”的压迫感场景。
- **“I am seized with an epistolary fervor”**：这是句子的核心。“epistolary fervor”是一个非常书面化和高级的表达，“epistolary”指“书信的”，“fervor”指“热情、热忱”，合起来就是“写信的热情”。“be seized with”意为“突然被（某种强烈情感）攫住”。
- **“that amounts to a craving”**：这是一个定语从句，修饰“fervor”。“craving”指“渴望、瘾”，说明这种写信的热情强烈到如同上瘾一般。
- **句子主旨**：这句话完美地印证了作者之前提出的“心理学原理”。正因为“写文章”是当前规定义务，平时最讨厌的“写信”突然变成了一种难以抗拒的诱惑和渴望。高级词汇与“slyly sneak”（偷偷摸摸地拿出）这种鬼祟行为形成鲜明对比，喜剧效果十足。

5. **"True, it is from a friend in Antwerp asking me to look him up when I am in Europe in the summer of 1929, so he can't actually be watching the incoming boats for an answer, but I owe something to politeness after all."**

- 剖析： 这个长句的幽默感来自于内容上的极端不合逻辑，它深刻揭示了拖延者为了自圆其说而构建的荒谬理由。
- **结构分析**：由“True,... so..., but...”连接的复合句，层层递进地展示了作者的心理活动。
- **荒谬的内容**：作者承认这封信是1929年（文章写作于30年代）一个朋友邀请他去欧洲时见面的，这封信早已完全过时，对方“不可能还在盯着驶来的客船等回信”（he can't actually be watching the incoming boats for an answer）。这是一个极具画面感的、充满冷幽默的描述。
- **荒谬的理由**：尽管信件完全失效，作者却用“but I owe something to politeness after all”（但我终究得讲点礼貌）作为回复这封信的理由。这个理由与事情的紧急性和必要性完全脱节，显得无比牵强和可笑。
- **句子主旨**：此句是作者自我欺骗和合理化拖延行为的绝佳案例。通过对一个极端情景的细致描绘，讽刺了人们在拖延时为自己寻找借口的普遍心态，即无论借口多么荒谬，只要能让自己心安理得地逃避主要任务就行。

6. **"When tomorrow comes I am up with one of the older and more sluggish larks."**

- 剖析： 这句话的理解难点在于它巧妙地化用了一个常见的英语习语，并赋予其全新的、相反的幽默含义。
- **原始习语**：“to be up with the lark”意为“像云雀一样早起”，形容起得非常早。云雀（lark）在西方文化中是早起报晓的象征。
- **作者的化用**：作者在“lark”前加上了定语“older and more sluggish”（更老、更懒散的）。一只又老又懒的云雀自然是飞不快的，也起不了那么早。
- **实际含义**：通过这个巧妙的改造，作者用一种非常诙谐、文艺且拐弯抹角的方式表达了“我第二天起得很晚”。他没有直白地说“I got up late”，而是用这种与原文风格一致的、充满智慧的文字游戏来传达信息，体现了高超的语言驾驭能力。
