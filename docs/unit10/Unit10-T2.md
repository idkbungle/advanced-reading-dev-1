What is to me most fascinating of all in retrospect about the entire episode is the evidence that it is possible for the heart to create its own bypass. A surgical bypass would have removed portions of veins from my leg and substituted them for the clogged portions of arteries going into the heart. The way nature accomplishes the same purpose is twofold. In response to the systematic regimen of careful diet, regular exercise, control of stress, and a philosophy of life that provides ample nourishment for the generous appetite of the spirit, the body slowly creates a rich network of new blood vessels across the heart, bypassing the deficient arteries with new conduits of its own, carrying the life-giving blood and oxygen.

今回首往事，最令我着迷的莫过于心脏能够自我搭桥的例证。外科搭桥手术本需从我的腿部取下部分静脉，用以替换通往心脏的堵塞动脉。而大自然实现同一目的的方式有二：其一，通过一套系统的养生之道——审慎的饮食、规律的锻炼、对压力的控制，以及能为丰盈的精神世界提供滋养的人生观——身体会响应这些努力，在心脏上缓慢地生发出丰富的新血管网络，以自建的新通道绕开缺损的动脉，输送赋予生命的血液与氧气。

The second way the damaged heart tries to meet its needs is through increased arterial flow. Not all medical opinion holds that arteries, once clogged, can never become unclogged. Scientific research has not yet established beyond question that the clogging substances will dissolve naturally. But what has been established is that even a little widening or clearing will accommodate a disproportionately larger blood flow. Some cardiologists believe that a course of action that does not add to the clogging will produce some shrinkage—enough, at least, to make possible such enhanced circulation.

受损心脏满足自身需求的第二种方式，是增加动脉血流量。并非所有医学观点都认为，动脉一旦堵塞便永无疏通之日。科学研究尚未毫无疑问地证实堵塞物会自然溶解，但已经确定的是，动脉哪怕只是些微的拓宽或清理，其血流量都会不成比例地大幅增加。一些心脏病专家相信，只要采取的措施不再加重堵塞，就能使堵塞物有所萎缩——至少足以改善血液循环。

Neither of those two processes is automatic. The ability of the heart to function in these ways does not become manifest under ordinary circumstances. Sometimes, indeed, the effects of blockage are so pervasive that surgical bypass is absolutely required to save a life. But a stern and unyielding regimen combining diet, exercise, and positive attitudes with the natural drive of the body to heal and regenerate can sometimes produce amazing results. So long as progress in this direction is discernible, it is reasonable to try to extend it as far as it will go. It is like the case of the stalled car that needs a push to give it enough momentum so that the gears, when engaged, can start the engine.

这两种过程都不是自动发生的。在通常情况下，心脏的这种功能并不会显现出来。事实上，有时堵塞造成的影响过于普遍，必须依靠外科搭桥手术才能挽救生命。但是，一套严格不苟的养生方案，若能将饮食、锻炼、积极心态与身体自我疗愈和再生的本能相结合，有时便能产生惊人的效果。只要能看到这方面的进步，就理应尽力将其推向极致。这好比一辆抛锚的汽车，需要有人推上一把，赋予其足够的冲力，齿轮才能啮合，从而发动引擎。

As I said earlier, I was extremely reluctant to undergo heart surgery; I wanted to see whether significant improvement was possible without it. If such improvement had not taken place, I would have accepted the option of surgery. The course I pursued was not an easy one; it should not be adopted by anyone who is not prepared to accept its highly disciplined requirements. Nor does my experience mean that what I did would necessarily work just as well for others.

如前所述，我当初极不情愿接受心脏手术，想看看不动刀是否也能取得显著改善。倘若病情未见好转，我也会接受手术这一选项。我所走的这条路并不轻松，任何没有准备好接受其极高自律要求的人，都不应采纳。我的经历也并不意味着我的做法就一定对他人同样有效。

The belief that illness is something that comes into us from the outside—a sort of hostile organism or substance that gains entry—is so firmly ingrained in us that we naturally look to available outside forces to do battle with it and evict it. Since we are attacked from without we tend to believe we can be rescued only from without. We have little knowledge of, and therefore little confidence in, the numberless ways the human body goes about righting itself. The absence of such knowledge leads not only to excessive dependence on external agencies but also to undue fears and even panic, which interfere with the proper functioning of the restorative mechanisms.

疾病是外来之物——某种侵入人体的敌对生物或物质——这种观念在我们心中根深蒂固，因此我们很自然地会寻求外部力量与之抗衡，并将其驱逐出去。我们既然是自外被攻击，就倾向于相信只有借助外力才能获救。对于人体以无数种方式进行自我修正的能力，我们知之甚少，因而也信心不足。这种知识的匮乏不仅导致我们过度依赖外部力量，还会引发不必要的恐惧乃至惊慌，而这些情绪反过来又会干扰机体修复机制的正常运作。

The role of the physician needs to be properly understood. The physician is best qualified to determine what is wrong and to intervene to whatever extent is necessary. In doing so, however, he combines his resources with the resources of the patient.

医生的角色需要得到恰当的理解。医生最有资格判断病症所在，并进行必要程度的干预。然而，在这一过程中，他是将自身的医疗资源与患者的内在潜能相结合。

Dr. Ingelfinger, the late editor of the New England Journal of Medicine, wrote that about 85 percent of the patients the physician is called upon to treat have self-limiting illnesses. That is, the human body is equipped to meet most of its own health problems. The doctor's job is to distinguish between the 85 percent that don't really need his ministrations and the 15 percent that do. The physician must then decide exactly what is required to reassure the 85 percent and to mobilize his knowledge and skills in dealing with the 15 percent.

已故的《新英格兰医学杂志》编辑英格尔芬格医生曾写道，在医生接诊的病人中，约有85%患的是自限性疾病。也就是说，人体有能力应对自身大部分的健康问题。医生的工作，就是要区分出那85%其实并不需要他干预的病人和那15%确实需要的病人。然后，医生必须准确判断，需要做些什么来安抚那85%的患者，并调动自己的知识与技能来处理那15%的病例。

In any case, a distinction must be made between the treating process and the healing process. The treating process seeks to do that which the body itself may be incapable of doing, but at the same time attempts, to the fullest possible extent, to restore the body's own healing capabilities. The notion that the center of the healing process is lodged with the physician is incorrect. It is lodged within the individual, and the wise physician knows how to summon and release it. The individual cannot expect to be relieved of all responsibility in the recovery effort. If he looks completely outside himself for help, he places an unreasonably large part of the burden on the physician and may retard his own recovery to that extent.

无论如何，我们必须分清“治疗过程”和“疗愈过程”。治疗过程旨在完成身体自身可能无法完成的任务，但同时也要尽最大可能恢复身体自身的疗愈能力。那种认为疗愈过程的核心在医生手里的观念，是错误的。它根植于患者自身，而明智的医生懂得如何唤醒并释放它。个人在康复过程中，不能指望免除所有责任。如果他完全向外求助，就会把过重的负担不合理地压在医生身上，并可能因此延误自己的康复。

What can the individual do? First of all, it is important to be aware of the body's natural drive to heal itself, once freed of the provocations that played a part in bringing on the illness. If a person has a heart attack, for example, the first order of business is to attempt to perceive possible connections between that heart attack and the precipitating causes. If, as in my case, I was engaged in a losing war against congested highways, airport mazes, delayed check-ins, overbooked planes, lost luggage, and late lecture arrivals, it was up to me to tame the schedule and make the necessary adjustments. Also, if my body craved exercise it was not receiving, only I was in a position to satisfy that want. And if my physical nourishment had to be augmented with nutrients for the mind, including joyous thoughts and experiences, I could not expect others to meet those needs for me.

个人能做些什么呢？首先，很重要的一点是，要认识到身体的自愈本能，一旦摆脱了那些诱发疾病的因素，这种本能就会被激发。比如，一个人心脏病发作，首要之事便是审视发病与可能诱因之间的关联。就我而言，我曾与拥堵的高速公路、迷宫般的机场、延误的登机手续、超售的航班、丢失的行李和迟到的演讲进行着一场注定失败的战争，那么我就有责任放缓日程，做出必要的调整。此外，如果我的身体渴求运动而不得，那么只有我自己才能满足这个需求。如果我的物质食粮必须辅以精神食粮——包括愉悦的思想和体验，我也不能指望他人来为我满足这些需求。

Each individual presides over the totality of himself or herself. Assuming life is worth living—and the act of reaching out for medical help is proof positive that we think it is—it is imperative that we take on that part of the battle that is uniquely ours. It is a serious error to think of medical treatment as a total answer to all the problems of illness. In the end, the war against serious illness calls not only for expert medical attention but also for a summoning of values. Victory may not always be possible—if it were, we would all live forever—but it is sometimes within reach even in cases when the conventional wisdom holds the opposite.

每个人都是自己身心全然的主宰。既然我们认为生命值得活下去——寻求医疗帮助的行为本身就是确凿的明证——我们就必须承担起这场战斗中唯有我们自己才能承担的那部分。认为医疗是解决所有疾病问题的万全之策，是一个严重的错误。归根结底，对抗重疾的战争不仅需要专业的医疗救治，也需要价值观的召唤。胜利并非总能企及——倘若如此，我们便可永生——但有时，即便在传统观念认为回天乏术之时，胜利也并非遥不可及。

It is in this sense that we retain control—recognizing the existence of resources represented by the healing system and the belief system that activates it. And the belief system is not just a collection of mechanical parts but a confluence of values and attitudes—hope, faith, confidence, purpose, will to live, and a capacity for joyous living.

正是在这个意义上，我们才掌握着控制权——认识到我们拥有疗愈系统以及激活这一系统的信念体系等资源。而信念体系并非机械部件的简单集合，而是价值观与态度的汇合——希望、信念、信心、目标、求生意志以及乐享生活的能力。

Few of us will pass through this lifetime without the challenge of one or more serious illnesses. We need not feel angry or guilty when that illness occurs, nor is it reasonable to expect that recovery is always within easy reach. But we have the obligation to ourselves and those we love not to invite defeat by being defeatist.

我们之中，很少有人能在一生中不经历一两次重病的挑战。当疾病降临时，我们不必愤怒或内疚，指望康复总是唾手可得也不切实际。但是，我们对自己、对我们所爱的人，都负有责任——不因悲观颓丧而自取其败。

If it is true that nothing is more striking about how the human body functions than its regenerative drive, it is also true that the regenerative drive works better under some circumstances than others. What we think, what we believe, what we eat, and what we do with our bodies are all involved in the circumstances of regeneration.

如果说人体机能最引人瞩目之处莫过于其再生动力，那么同样真实的是，这股再生动力在某些条件下会比在其他条件下运作得更好。我们的所思、所信、所食、所为，都与再生的条件息息相关。

If it is important to avoid a sense of defeat, it is equally important to avoid a sense of guilt when progress or recovery may not be possible. Although we want to be able to mobilize all the resources inside us and make the fullest use of the resources outside us, there are times when disease cannot be reversed. We need not feel, at such times, that we have somehow failed, or that our faith and hope were insufficient to our requirements. Nor need we feel that personal adequacy or character is measured only by the ability to prevail.

避免失败感固然重要，但当病情无法好转或康复无望时，避免内疚感也同样重要。尽管我们希望动员体内的一切资源，并充分利用体外的一切资源，但总有些时候，疾病是无法逆转的。在这种时候，我们不必觉得自己失败了，或认为自己的信念与希望不足以支撑需求。我们更不必觉得，个人的价值或品格，只能通过战胜病魔来衡量。

The ultimate truth about life is that it is transient. We have a certain margin for the pursuit of our aims; we have powerful natural assets in the form of the will to live and a joyous response to life. These assets serve us well and help us to make the most out of ourselves; but they are not eternal elixirs. To feel despair or guilt because we may not always be successful in overcoming illness is to put ourselves above the basic laws of life.

生命的终极真相，在于其短暂无常。我们尚有余地去追寻目标；我们也拥有强大的天赋资本，那就是求生的意志和对生命喜悦的回应。这些资本助益我们，帮助我们实现自我价值的最大化；但它们并非永生的灵丹。因未必总能战胜疾病便感到绝望或内疚，就是将自己置于生命的基本法则之上。

We are not capable of banishing death. The final triumph is beyond us. But we are entitled to the fullest measure of help the world has to offer, just as those who are close to us are entitled to feel that we ourselves have offered the best within us. Death becomes tragic only when we have allowed things to die inside us that give meaning to life.

我们无法驱逐死亡，最终的胜利非我们力所能及。但是，我们有权得到这世界所能给予的全部帮助，正如我们身边的人有权感受到我们已然付出了最好的自己。只有当那些赋予生命意义的东西在我们内心先行枯萎之时，死亡才变得悲戚。

Even when the verdict is certain, we are not barred from the exercise of powers that rarely come into play at other times. I think of Hans Zinsser, the physician-philosopher, stricken with incurable illness, writing about the wide range of new perceptions that enabled him to sense and see things he had never sensed or seen before. His book As I Remember Him is a tribute not just to the man but to the uniqueness of human life.

即便结局已定，我们依然可以运用那些平日里鲜有机会施展的力量。我想起了医生兼哲学家汉斯·津瑟，他身患绝症，却写下了他获得的种种新感悟，这些感悟让他感知和看到了前所未见的事物。他的著作《我记忆中的他》，不仅是对这位伟人的致敬，也是对人类生命之独特的礼赞。

"My mind is more alive and vivid than ever before," he wrote during his illness in a passage remarkably similar to L.E. Trombley's observations quoted earlier in this book. "My sensitivities are keener; my affections stronger. I seem for the first time to see the world in clear perspective. I love people more deeply and comprehensively. I seem to be just beginning to learn my business and see my work in its proper relationship to science as a whole. I seem to myself to have entered into a period of stronger feelings and saner understanding."

“我的心智从未像现在这样敏锐鲜活，”他在病中写道，这段话与本书前面引用的L·E·特龙布利所见惊人地相似。“我的感觉更加敏锐，情感也愈发深厚。我似乎第一次以清晰的视角看待世界。我更深刻、更全面地爱着人们。我好像才刚刚开始领悟我的事业，并从科学的整体格局中看待我的工作。我觉得自己进入了一个情感更强烈、认知更清醒的时期。”

Zinsser made an important discovery about life—the way time can be transformed into energy. Time is the most important capital we own. We can lose great fortunes, and, if we are lucky, we may be able to regain them. But time is the only source of wealth which, once spent, can never be regained. There is only a finite amount of it for every person. "Ask me for anything," Napoleon is supposed to have said at the height of his power, "and I will be able to give it to you. Anything, that is, except time."

津瑟对生命有了一个重要的发现——时间可以转化为能量。时间是我们拥有的最重要资本。我们可能失去万贯家财，如果幸运，或许还能失而复得。但时间是唯一的财富，一旦花费，便永难复得。每个人拥有的时间都是有限的。据说拿破仑在权力巅峰时曾说：“向我索要任何东西，我都能给你。任何东西，除了时间。”

The way we choose to live and the depth of our feelings, our ability to love and be loved and to take in all the colors of the world around us—these determine the worth and true extent of whatever time we have. The clock keeps ticking away. Our job is to put as much meaning as possible into the intervals between the ticks. A minute can open out into a vast realm in which all our senses, finely attuned, can come into full and splendid play—or those same senses can be shut down, imparting nothing to our years except numbers.

我们选择的生活方式、我们情感的深度、我们爱与被爱的能力以及领略周遭世界万千色彩的能力——这些决定了我们所拥有的任何时间的价值与真正广度。时钟滴答前行，我们的任务，便是在滴答声的间隙里，尽可能地注入意义。一分钟可以化为一个广阔的领域，我们所有高度协调的感觉，都可以在其中尽情施展，大放异彩——又或者，这些感觉可以被关闭，给岁月留下的，除了数字，空无一物。

What makes time so valuable is that it is convertible into nourishing memory. Memory is where the proof of life is stored. It offers material for stock-taking and provides clues about where our lives are going.

时间之所以宝贵，在于它能转化为滋养心灵的记忆。记忆是生命留下印证之所在。它为我们盘点过往提供了素材，也为我们的人生走向提供了线索。

Serious illness can be redemptive if it opens the sluices of vital memory, sharpens the focus, transforms the improbable into the possible, and imparts a quality of high art to the gift of time.

一场重病，如果能打开生命记忆的闸门，让焦点变得清晰，化不可能为可能，并赋予时间这份礼物崇高的艺术品格，那么它本身就是一种救赎。

摘自：C·施罗德斯，第734-737页。 **En**
 The article argues that the human body possesses profound self-healing capabilities, exemplified by the heart's ability to create natural bypasses through a disciplined regimen of diet, exercise, and a positive mindset. The author challenges the common view of illness as a purely external threat requiring external cures, highlighting the patient's critical role and responsibility in their own healing process. This involves activating the body's restorative mechanisms through a robust belief system—comprising hope, purpose, and the will to live. Ultimately, the text reframes serious illness not as a defeat, but as a potential catalyst for gaining a deeper perspective on life, valuing time, and finding meaning even in the face of mortality.

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"In response to the systematic regimen of careful diet, regular exercise, control of stress, and a philosophy of life that provides ample nourishment for the generous appetite of the spirit, the body slowly creates a rich network of new blood vessels across the heart, bypassing the deficient arteries with new conduits of its own, carrying the life-giving blood and oxygen."**

- 剖析： 这是一个典型的超长句，其核心主干被一个冗长的状语结构和多个后置修饰成分隔开，增加了理解难度。
    - **结构拆解**： 句子的主干是 “the body slowly creates a rich network of new blood vessels”。句子开头由 “In response to...” 引导的介词短语作状语，详细说明了身体产生这种变化的条件。这个状语的宾语是一个由四个并列名词性成分构成的复杂结构：“systematic regimen...”、“regular exercise...”、“control of stress...”、“a philosophy of life...”。
    - **难点解析**：
        1. **抽象隐喻**：“a philosophy of life that provides ample nourishment for the generous appetite of the spirit”（为精神的巨大胃口提供充足营养的人生哲学）。这里将“spirit”（精神）比作有“appetite”（胃口）的生命体，而“philosophy of life”（人生哲学）则被比作能满足其胃口的“nourishment”（营养）。这种生动的比喻强调了积极、乐观的精神世界对身体健康的滋养作用。
        2. **后置修饰**：句子末尾的 “bypassing... carrying...” 是两个现在分词短语，作伴随状语，补充说明 “a rich network of new blood vessels” 的功能，即这个新血管网络“绕过了有缺陷的动脉”并且“输送着维持生命的血液和氧气”。这使得句子的信息量层层递进，结构复杂。

2. **"The belief that illness is something that comes into us from the outside—a sort of hostile organism or substance that gains entry—is so firmly ingrained in us that we naturally look to available outside forces to do battle with it and evict it."**

- 剖析： 此句的难点在于其复杂的句子结构，包含同位语从句、插入语和结果状语从句。
    - **结构拆解**： 句子的主语是 “The belief”，其后紧跟一个由 “that” 引导的同位语从句 “illness is something...”，具体解释 “belief” 的内容。破折号之间的 “a sort of hostile organism or substance that gains entry” 是对 “something that comes into us from the outside” 的进一步解释，属于插入语。句子的谓语部分采用了 “is so... that...” 结构，即“如此...以至于...”，引出结果状语从句 “that we naturally look to...”。
    - **难点解析**：
        1. **嵌套结构**： 整个主语部分（The belief... gains entry）非常长，读者需要先识别出核心主语“The belief”，才能找到谓语“is so firmly ingrained...”。
        2. **军事隐喻**： “look to available outside forces to do battle with it and evict it”（指望外部力量与之战斗并将其驱逐）。这里将治疗过程比作一场战争，疾病是“入侵者”，而药物、手术等外部手段是“雇佣军”，生动地刻画了人们普遍依赖外力对抗疾病的思维定势。

3. **"If, as in my case, I was engaged in a losing war against congested highways, airport mazes, delayed check-ins, overbooked planes, lost luggage, and late lecture arrivals, it was up to me to tame the schedule and make the necessary adjustments."**

- 剖析： 此句的理解难度在于其生动且密集的比喻性语言，用以描绘现代生活的压力。
    - **结构拆解**： 这是一个条件状语从句（If...），主句是 “it was up to me to...”。其中插入了 “as in my case” 作为补充说明。
    - **难点解析**：
        1. **战争比喻**：“engaged in a losing war against...”。作者将自己与日常生活中一系列令人烦躁的琐事（交通拥堵、机场迷宫、延误等）的关系比作一场“注定要失败的战争”，形象地传达了那种无力、受挫和持续的压力感。
        2. **形象化词语**：“airport mazes”（机场迷宫）比喻机场复杂的布局和繁琐的程序。“tame the schedule”（驯服日程）则是一个非常巧妙的动宾搭配，将紧张失控的日程表比作一头需要“驯服”的野兽，意味着要主动去掌控它，而不是被它牵着鼻子走。

4. **"In the end, the war against serious illness calls not only for expert medical attention but also for a summoning of values."**

- 剖析： 这句话的难度在于其高度抽象和哲理化的表达。它将医疗问题提升到了精神和价值观层面。
    - **结构拆解**： 句子结构是 “not only... but also...” (不但...而且...)，连接两个并列的宾语：“expert medical attention” 和 “a summoning of values”。
    - **难点解析**：
        1. **抽象概念**：“a summoning of values”（价值观的召唤）。这是一个非常抽象的短语。“Summoning” 意为“召唤、召集”，通常用于召唤军队或神灵，这里指代一种主动、郑重地调动内在精神力量的行为。“Values”（价值观）则指希望、信念、人生目标等精神支柱。整个短语的意思是，战胜重病不仅需要专业的医疗救助，更需要个体主动唤醒并运用自己内心的核心信念和精神力量。这句话是全文从“身体疗愈”转向“精神疗愈”的核心观点之一。

5. **"And the belief system is not just a collection of mechanical parts but a confluence of values and attitudes—hope, faith, confidence, purpose, will to live, and a capacity for joyous living."**

- 剖析： 此句的精妙之处在于使用了高级词汇和对比隐喻来定义一个核心概念。
    - **结构拆解**： 句子使用了“not just... but...”的对比结构。破折号后的部分是对“a confluence of values and attitudes”的具体列举和阐释。
    - **难点解析**：
        1. **对比隐喻**：句子将“信念系统”与“a collection of mechanical parts”（一堆机械零件的集合）进行对比，否定了那种认为信念只是各个独立部分简单拼凑的机械论观点。
        2. **核心词汇**：“confluence”是理解本句的关键。其本意是“（河流）汇合处”，在此处作比喻，指代各种价值观和态度（如希望、信心、求生意志等）像不同支流一样，汇聚、融合在一起，形成一股强大而统一的精神力量。这个词生动地表达了信念系统的整体性、动态性和协同作用，远比“集合”（collection）一词更有生命力。

6. **"Serious illness can be redemptive if it opens the sluices of vital memory, sharpens the focus, transforms the improbable into the possible, and imparts a quality of high art to the gift of time."**

- 剖析： 这句话充满诗意和哲理，使用了多个并列的隐喻来阐述疾病可能带来的积极转变，理解难度较高。
    - **结构拆解**： 这是一个条件句，主句是“Serious illness can be redemptive”，if从句中包含四个并列的动词短语，描述疾病如何实现这种“救赎”。
    - **难点解析**：
        1. **哲理词汇**：“redemptive”（有救赎作用的）。这个词带有宗教和哲学意味，指疾病能弥补过去的缺憾，或使生命得到升华，本身就是一个高度概括的抽象概念。
        2. **生动隐喻**：
            - “opens the sluices of vital memory”：“sluice”指水闸。这个比喻意为疾病能“打开关键记忆的闸门”，让大量被遗忘或忽视的重要记忆涌现出来，帮助人重新审视人生。
            - “imparts a quality of high art to the gift of time”：意为“赋予‘时间’这份礼物一种高级艺术的品质”。这是一个极富美感的表达，意思是疾病能让人不再浑噩度日，而是像艺术家对待作品一样，精心雕琢、深刻体验和珍视所拥有的每一刻时间，从而让生命的价值和深度大大提升。
