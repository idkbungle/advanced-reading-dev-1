The sense of being locked into a body that is inadequate for its needs, the sense of living under a lowering ceiling, the sense of having to separate oneself from vital prospects, the sense of coming to terms with bleakness—all these are the stuff of invalidism. The person who is put on notice by the physician that he or she has a "bad heart" tends to live a life of reduced expectations, to take slower and fewer steps, and to move more tentatively in the outside world.

身体为牢，力不从心之感；人生天地，日渐狭隘之感；与美好前景，分道扬镳之感；向惨淡现实，俯首称臣之感——凡此种种，皆是病患心态的真实写照。当一个人被医生告知“心脏不好”时，往往会降低对生活的期许，步履变得迟缓，在外部世界里也愈发畏缩不前。

How does one avoid the feeling of being an invalid when underlying conditions create and indeed seem to dictate it? When a physician tells you that your heart is weak and must be spared the strains that other people routinely and joyously bear, how do you go through life without flinching when you approach stairs or hilly streets or children reaching out to be lifted?

当潜在的病症似乎已注定了这一切时，人如何能摆脱病患之感？当医生告诉你，你的心脏很虚弱，必须避免常人习以为常、乐于承受的负荷时，你在面对楼梯、坡道，或是伸出双臂要你抱起的孩子时，又如何能做到毫不畏缩，勇往直前？

Perhaps the best way to answer these questions is to begin by reflecting on the way the human body works. A weak body becomes weaker in a mood of total surrender. The mechanisms of repair and rehabilitation that are built into the human system have a natural drive to assert themselves under conditions of illness, but that natural tendency is deferred or deflected by an erosion of the will to live, or by the absence of confidence in one's physician or in one's own ability to play a vital part in the attack on disease.

要回答这些问题，最好的方法或许是先思索一下人体的运作方式。在彻底放弃的心境下，虚弱的身体只会变得更加虚弱。人体内置的修复与康复机制，在患病时会有一种自我彰显的天然动力，但求生意志的消磨，或对医生、对自身抗病能力缺乏信心，都会延缓或扭转这种天然趋势。

Obviously, it is absurd to suppose that there is no illness or somber circumstance that can't be reversed. But it is also true that under conditions of extreme illness we need all the help we can get. For the same reason it is necessary to put all our own powers to work in our own behalf. We want to get the most out of whatever is possible. An integral part of this process is respect for the human body—an organism of astounding tenacity, resiliency, and recuperative capability. And, since the human body tends to move in the direction of its expectations—plus or minus—it is important to know that attitudes of confidence and determination are no less a part of the treatment program than medical science and technology.

诚然，认为任何疾病或晦暗处境都无法逆转的想法是荒谬的。然而，身患重病之时，我们也的确需要一切可能的帮助。同理，我们必须调动自身的一切力量为自己服务，竭力将所有潜能发挥到极致。这个过程不可或缺的一部分，便是尊重我们的身体——它是一个具有惊人坚韧性、弹性和自愈能力的生命体。而且，既然身体的走向——无论是积极还是消极——往往取决于人的期望，那么我们就必须明白，自信和决心，在整个治疗方案中，其重要性不亚于现代医学与科技。

The day after I came home from the hospital, I arranged with a building contractor to construct a new study and storage facility for all the Saturday Review files and other books and records that had been moved out from the East. The only place available for the new construction was above a steep hill in the back of the house. This meant I would have to climb the equivalent of four flights of stairs every time I wanted to go to the study.

出院回家的第二天，我就联系了一位建筑承包商，为我修建一间新的书房和储藏室，用来存放所有从东部搬来的《星期六评论》的文档以及其他书籍和资料。唯一可供施工的地方在屋后一处陡峭的山坡上。这意味着每回去书房，我都得爬上相当于四层楼的高度。

The building was completed in about three months. I have never felt the slightest hesitation in making the ascent, which I have done at least twice daily. The sense of pleasurable anticipation is enough to allow me to endure any strain.

这间屋子大约三个月后完工。我每天至少要爬上爬下两次，却从未有过丝毫犹豫。那种愉悦的期待感，足以让我承受任何劳累。

I do know this, however: if I had any distasteful expectations or reactions my body would supply all the signs of chest pressure to accommodate that distaste. More and more, I am inclined to accept the notion that the body produces its own poisons under circumstances of apprehension or emotional strain and that this factor is intimately involved in serious illness, whether it takes the form of cardiac disease, joint disabilities, or even cancer. The title of Kenneth Pelletier's book "Mind as Healer, Mind as Slayer" may say it all.

然而，我深知一点：倘若我心存任何厌恶的期待或反应，我的身体便会出现胸闷的迹象来迎合这种厌恶。我越来越倾向于接受这样一种观念：在忧惧或情绪紧张之下，身体会自生毒素，而这一因素与各种重疾密切相关，无论是心脏病、关节残疾，还是癌症。肯尼思·佩尔蒂埃的著作《心乃良医，心亦杀手》这一书名，或许已道尽了一切。

Nothing is more amazing or heartening to me than to see the way in which many persons with severe afflictions or handicaps nonetheless manage to affirm life. Just in the act of mobilizing their emotional resources they help to potentiate themselves physically. I am not saying here that no one ever need feel disadvantaged; all I am doing is making a distinction between being an invalid and thinking and acting like one.

对我而言，最令人惊叹、最鼓舞人心的，莫过于看到许多身患重疾或残障的人们，依然设法肯定生命。他们仅仅通过调动自身的情感资源，便有助于激发自己的身体潜能。我在此并非说人永远不必感到身处劣势，我只是想区分“身为病患”和“言行心态如病患”这两者。

I know that I am still at risk. I know that, without warning, my heart could suddenly fail. If that should happen, I will have no complaints. As I told Dr. Shine, I have nothing but gratitude for a heart that has seen me through an eventful life and several medical ordeals, beginning in childhood.

我知道自己仍有风险，也知道我的心脏可能在毫无预警的情况下突然衰竭。倘若真如此，我亦无怨无悔。正如我告诉夏因医生的，我这颗心，伴我度过了跌宕起伏的一生和数次始于童年的病痛考验，对此我唯有感恩。

Death is not the enemy; living in constant fear of it is. I have no intention of swathing myself in cotton to soften a possibly fatal episode. I will continue to live and think as actively and creatively as it is physically possible for me to do, knowing that longevity by itself can be sterile but that vital feelings and thoughts give meaning and depth to life and provide a true sense of the possibilities of human existence.

死亡并非大敌，对死亡的恒久恐惧才是。我无意用棉花把自己层层包裹，来缓冲那可能致命的一击。我将继续在身体允许的范围内，尽可能积极地生活，活跃地思考，因为我深知，长寿本身可能是空洞的，而鲜活的情感与思想才能赋予生命以意义和深度，并让人真正领悟到人类生存的无限可能。

I have already lived more than an average lifetime, but I want to continue to live long enough to see the establishment of a world under law and a planet made safe and fit for human habitation. I hope, too, to live long enough to see the conquest of human squalor. What stands in the way is not insufficiency of natural resources but the way people choose to think about their problems and opportunities. In any event, I am grateful that I am able to continue working for those causes that seek to free our age from gross indignities and the fear of nuclear devastation.

我活过的岁月已超过常人的平均寿命，但我希望能活得更久，亲眼看到一个法治世界的建立，一个让全人类安居乐业的地球家园。我也希望能活到亲眼目睹人类根除自身丑恶的那一天。阻碍这一切的，并非自然资源的匮乏，而是人们看待问题与机遇的思维方式。无论如何，我心怀感激，因为我还能继续为那些崇高的事业而奋斗，力求将我们的时代从巨大的屈辱和核毁灭的恐惧中解放出来。

What seems especially important to me in retrospect is that I am the beneficiary of the best that modern medical science has to offer. For many years, deaths from heart attacks have outnumbered fatalities from all other diseases. That number is now on the decline and will, I believe, decline further still with the full recognition, not just by the profession but by the general public, that a comprehensive program of treatment involves both the full utilization of medical science and the full development of the human healing system. The fact that the belief system can be a vital activator of the healing system may open the door to an auspicious future in medical research and practice.

回首往事，我感到尤为重要的一点是，我是现代顶尖医学昌明之下的受益者。多年以来，心脏病发作的致死人数一直超过所有其他疾病。如今这一数字正在下降，而且我相信，随着不仅是医学界，更是广大民众都充分认识到，一个全面的治疗方案既要充分利用现代医学，也要充分开发人体的自愈系统，这个数字还会进一步下降。信念系统可以成为自愈系统的重要激活器——这一事实，或许会为未来的医学研究与实践开启一扇吉祥之门。

I look up at the calendar as I put down these final notes and see that it is two years and five months since the heart attack of December 22, 1980. Dr. Shine has gone out of his way to congratulate me, using the word "magnificent" to describe my progress, even though he feels I may still be at substantial risk. Dr. Cannom does not refute the fact of ongoing risk but sees no evidence that my heart is not getting all the blood and oxygen my life style requires. The portion of the heart muscle that was destroyed during the heart attack will not regenerate; but the rest of the heart muscle has been strengthened and has adapted itself to my needs. Dr. Cannom says it is difficult to believe that bypass surgery could have achieved a better functional result than has been achieved without it. The original treadmill results that produced the finding of severe coronary insufficiency have been reversed.

写下这些最后的话语时，我抬头看了一眼日历，自1980年12月22日心脏病发作以来，已过了两年零五个月。夏因医生特意向我道贺，用“卓越”一词形容我的进展，尽管他觉得我可能仍面临巨大风险。卡农医生不否认风险依然存在，但他认为，种种迹象表明，我的心脏完全能够获得我的生活方式所需的血液和氧气。心脏病发作时坏死的那部分心肌不会再生，但余下的心肌已经得到强化，并已适应了我的需求。卡农医生说，很难相信心脏搭桥手术能取得比现在（不手术）更好的功能性结果。当初那份显示我严重冠状动脉供血不足的踏车测试结果，如今已被彻底逆转。

I manage to set aside time each week for the sports I enjoy—doubles or singles in tennis, and golf with old friends. Golf does not really qualify as exercise, but it is a game that offers tangible and tantalizing possibilities for measurable improvement of one's skill. Besides, it provides an arena for banter and the rewards of companionship in an outdoor setting. I maintain a full working schedule, and I pay visits to the hospital at the request of physicians to see ill persons in need of a morale boost. The difference between what I did before the heart attack and what I am doing now is that I now maintain some semblance of control. I try to run my schedule instead of letting the schedule run me.

我每周都设法抽出时间，享受我喜爱的运动——打网球双打或单打，以及和老朋友们一起打高尔夫。高尔夫算不上真正的锻炼，但这项运动能让你的球技获得实实在在、看得见的提升，其乐无穷。此外，它还提供了一个在户外与同伴谈天说地、享受友谊的场所。我保持着满满的工作日程，也应医生之邀去医院探望那些需要精神鼓舞的病人。与心脏病发作前相比，现在的不同之处在于，我如今总算能掌控自己的生活节奏了。我努力驾驭我的日程，而不是让日程来驾驭我。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"The sense of being locked into a body that is inadequate for its needs, the sense of living under a lowering ceiling, the sense of having to separate oneself from vital prospects, the sense of coming to terms with bleakness—all these are the stuff of invalidism."**

- 剖析： 这是一个由四个并列名词性短语构成的超长主语从句，极具文学性和画面感。句子的主干是 “all these are the stuff of invalidism”（所有这些构成了病患心态的实质）。主语 “all these” 指代的是前面并列的四种“感觉”：
    - “being locked into a body that is inadequate for its needs”：比喻感觉自己被“锁在”一个无法满足自身需求的身体里，强调一种无能为力的囚禁感。
    - “living under a lowering ceiling”：比喻生活空间和可能性“不断降低的天花板”，形象地描绘出人生前景日益受限、令人窒息的压抑感。
    - “having to separate oneself from vital prospects”：指被迫放弃那些“至关重要的前景”，比如事业、梦想和重要的人生计划，这是一种被剥夺未来的感觉。
    - “coming to terms with bleakness”：指不得不“与凄凉和解”，即接受一个黯淡无望的现实。
    - “the stuff of invalidism”：“stuff” 在这里指“本质、要素、材料”，“invalidism”指“病患状态或病患心态”。整个短语的意思是“构成病患心态的核心要素”。
    总而言之，该句通过一连串生动的比喻，层层递进地刻画出一个人在心理上将自己定义为“病人”时所体验到的被囚禁、受压抑、被剥夺和最终妥协于绝望的复杂感受。

2. **"The mechanisms of repair and rehabilitation that are built into the human system have a natural drive to assert themselves under conditions of illness, but that natural tendency is deferred or deflected by an erosion of the will to live..."**

- 剖析： 这是一个复杂的复合句，通过“but”连接了两个相对比的观点。
    - 前半句的主干是 “The mechanisms... have a natural drive...”。主语“The mechanisms of repair and rehabilitation”（修复和康复的机制）由一个定语从句 “that are built into the human system”（人体系统内置的）修饰，说明这种机制是与生俱来的。谓语中的“assert themselves”意为“坚持自己的主张，显示自己的存在”，这里指人体的自愈能力在生病时会“自动发挥作用”。
    - 后半句用“but”转折，指出这种天生的趋势（that natural tendency）可能会被阻碍。“deferred or deflected”意为“被延迟或被转移方向”，即自愈能力无法正常发挥。
    - 阻碍的原因是“an erosion of the will to live”，这是一个非常形象的表达。“Erosion”本意是“侵蚀、腐蚀”，这里比喻“求生意志”像水土流失一样被一点点消耗殆尽，强调了心理状态对生理机能的负面影响。这句话深刻揭示了身心互动的原理：人体虽有强大的自愈系统，但消极的心理状态（如求生意志的消磨）能够压制甚至摧毁这种生理本能。

3. **"And, since the human body tends to move in the direction of its expectations—plus or minus—it is important to know that attitudes of confidence and determination are no less a part of the treatment program than medical science and technology."**

- 剖析： 此句包含一个原因状语从句和一个主句，核心在于“no less... than”这个比较结构。
    - “since”引导的原因状语从句“since the human body tends to move in the direction of its expectations—plus or minus—”提出了一个前提：人体倾向于朝着其期望的方向发展。“plus or minus”是一个插入语，意为“或好或坏、或积极或消极”，即“安慰剂效应”和“反安慰剂效应”并存。你的期望是积极的，身体可能向好的方向发展；反之亦然。
    - 主句的核心信息在 “attitudes... are no less a part of... than medical science...”。“no less... than...” 结构表示“与...同样重要，不亚于...”。它强调了前后两者的同等重要性。
    - 因此，这句话的逻辑是：正因为人的身体会受到期望的影响，所以我们必须认识到，“信心和决心”这种积极态度，在整个治疗方案中，其重要性“丝毫不亚于”现代医学和技术。它雄辩地论证了心理力量在治疗中不可或缺的地位。

4. **"Just in the act of mobilizing their emotional resources they help to potentiate themselves physically."**

- 剖析： 这句话的难点在于其抽象的词汇和精炼的表达。“mobilizing their emotional resources” 和 “potentiate themselves physically” 都是高度概括的短语。
    - “mobilizing their emotional resources”：“Mobilize”原意是“动员（军队等）”，这里比喻“调动、激起”。“Emotional resources”指“情感资源”，包括勇气、希望、乐观、决心等内在力量。整个短语的意思是“仅仅通过调动自身情感力量这一行为”。
    - “potentiate themselves physically”：“Potentiate”是一个较为专业的词汇，意为“增强...的效能/力量”。在这里指“增强他们自身的体能或生理机能”。
    - 句子的意思是：当人们仅仅在做“调动内在情感力量”这件事时，他们就在帮助自己“增强身体的潜能”。这句话点明了精神到物质的转化过程：一个纯粹的心理行为（调动情绪）可以直接产生一个生理上的积极结果（身体机能被强化）。

5. **"I have no intention of swathing myself in cotton to soften a possibly fatal episode."**

- 剖析： 这句话的理解关键在于其生动且强烈的隐喻。“Swathing myself in cotton” 字面意思是“用棉花把自己包裹起来”。
    - “Swathe in cotton” 在这里比喻“过度保护自己，让自己生活在一种隔绝风险、极其脆弱的环境中”，就像用柔软的棉花包裹易碎品一样。这是一种非常形象的说法，表达了对过度谨慎、畏缩不前生活方式的排斥。
    - “to soften a possibly fatal episode”：目的是“为了缓冲一次可能致命的事件”。“soften”意为“软化、减缓冲击”，“fatal episode”指可能发生的致命性心脏病发作。
    - 结合起来，作者用这个比喻鲜明地表明了自己的态度：他绝不打算为了避免可能发生的死亡风险，而把自己像易碎品一样层层包裹起来，过一种胆小如鼠、毫无生趣的生活。他宁愿承担风险，也要活得真实而有活力。

6. **"The fact that the belief system can be a vital activator of the healing system may open the door to an auspicious future in medical research and practice."**

- 剖析： 这是一个结构复杂的主语从句。“The fact”是主语的核心词，其后跟着一个由“that”引导的同位语从句，详细解释“fact”的内容。
    - 同位语从句是：“that the belief system can be a vital activator of the healing system”（信念系统可以成为疗愈系统的一个关键激活器）。这个从句是全句思想的核心。“Belief system”指人的信念、信心体系。“Vital activator”指“至关重要的激活装置/催化剂”。“Healing system”指人体的自愈系统。这句话指出了一个核心观点：信念能启动人体的自愈力。
    - 句子的谓语是“may open the door to...”。“Open the door to”是固定搭配，意为“为...打开大门，为...提供可能性”。
    - “an auspicious future”指一个“充满希望的、吉利的未来”。
    - 整个句子的意思是：“信念系统可以成为自愈系统的关键激活器”这一事实，可能会为未来的医学研究和实践开启一扇通往光明前景的大门。这句话是对全文思想的升华和总结，预言了将心理信念纳入主流医疗的广阔前景。
