A round, green cardboard sign hangs from a string proclaiming, "We built a proud new feeling," the slogan of a local supermarket. It is a souvenir from one of my brother's last jobs. In addition to being a bagger, he's worked at a fast-food restaurant, a gas station, a garage and a textile factory. Now, in the icy clutches of the Northeastern winter, he is unemployed. He will soon be a father. He is 19 years old.

一块绿色的圆形纸板悬挂着，上面写着“我们营造了一种引以为豪的新感觉”——这是当地一家超市的标语，也是我哥哥上一份工作的纪念品。他做过超市装袋员，还在快餐店、加油站、汽修厂和纺织厂打过工。而今，东北部的寒冬料峭，他失业在家，很快就要当父亲了。他年方十九。

In mid-December I was at Stanford, among the palm trees and weighty chores of academe. And all I wanted to do was get out. I joined the rest of the undergrads in a chorus of excitement, singing the praises of Christmas break. No classes, no midterms, no finals... and no freshmen! (I'm a resident assistant.) Awesome! I was looking forward to escaping. I never gave a thought to what I was escaping to.

十二月中旬，我还在斯坦福，身处棕榈树的环抱和繁重的学业之中。那时，我一心只想离开。我和其他本科生一样，兴奋地加入合唱，歌颂着圣诞假期的美好。没有课，没有期中考，没有期末考……也没有新生要管！（我是一名住宿助理。）太棒了！我盼望着逃离，却从未想过，自己将要逃往何方。

Once I got home to New Jersey, reality returned. My dreaded freshmen had been replaced by unemployed relatives; badgering professors had been replaced by hard-working single mothers, and cold classrooms by dilapidated bedrooms and kitchens. The room in which the "proud new feeling" sign hung contained the belongings of myself, my mom and my brother. But for these two weeks it was mine. They slept downstairs on couches.

一回到新泽西的家，现实感便扑面而来。我那群头疼的新生换成了失业的亲戚；絮叨的教授换成了辛劳的单身母亲；冰冷的教室换成了破败的卧室和厨房。挂着那块“引以为豪的新感觉”标语的房间，堆放着我、母亲和哥哥三人的东西。但在这两周里，它属于我。他们则睡在楼下的沙发上。

Most students who travel between the universes of poverty and affluence during breaks experience similar conditions, as well as the guilt, the helplessness and, sometimes, the embarrassment associated with them. Our friends are willing to listen, but most of them are unable to imagine the pain of the impoverished lives that we see every six months. Each time I return home I feel further away from the realities of poverty in America and more ashamed that they are allowed to persist. What frightens me most is not that the American socioeconomic system permits poverty to continue, but that by participating in that system I share some of the blame.

大多数在贫与富两个世界间穿梭的学生，假期里都会有类似的经历，并体验着与此相伴的愧疚、无助，有时还有难堪。朋友们愿意倾听，但他们大多无法想象我们每隔半年所目睹的那种贫困生活的痛楚。每回一次家，我便感到自己离美国贫困的现实更远一分，也为这种现实被容许存在而更添一分羞愧。最让我恐惧的，并非是美国的社会经济制度任由贫困延续，而是我，作为这个制度的参与者，也难辞其咎。

Last year I lived in an on-campus apartment, with a (relatively) modern bathroom, kitchen and two bedrooms. Using summer earnings, I added some expensive prints, a potted palm and some other plants, making the place look like the more-than-humble abode of a New York City Yuppie. I gave dinner parties, even a soiree française.

去年，我住在校内的一套公寓里，有相对现代的卫浴、厨房和两间卧室。我用暑期打工的收入添置了一些昂贵的版画、一盆棕榈树和其他几盆植物，把那儿装点得像个纽约雅皮士的安乐窝，早已超出了简朴的范畴。我时常举办晚宴，甚至还办过法式派对。

For my roommate, a doctor's son, this kind of life was nothing extraordinary. But my mom was struggling to provide a life for herself and my brother. In addition to working 24-hour-a-day cases as a practical nurse, she was trying to ensure that my brother would graduate from high school and have a decent life. She knew that she had to compete for his attention with drugs and other potentially dangerous things that can look attractive to a young man when he sees no better future.

对我的室友——一位医生的儿子而言，这种生活稀松平常。可我的母亲却在为她自己和我哥哥的生计苦苦挣扎。她是一名护工，常常需要24小时轮班看护病人。此外，她还要费尽心思，确保我哥哥能念完高中，过上体面的生活。她知道，当一个年轻人看不到更好的未来时，毒品和其他潜在的危险事物便会充满诱惑，她必须与这些东西争夺儿子的注意力。

Living in my grandmother's house this Christmas break restored all the forgotten, and the never acknowledged, guilt. I had gone to boarding school on a full scholarship since the ninth grade, so being away from poverty was not new. But my own growing affluence has increased my distance. My friends say that I should not feel guilty: what could I do substantially for my family at this age, they ask. Even though I know that education is the right thing to do, I can't help but feel, sometimes, that I have it too good. There is no reason that I deserve security and warmth, while my brother has to cope with potential unemployment and prejudice. I, too, encounter prejudice, but it is softened by my status as a student in an affluent and intellectual community.

这个圣诞假期住外婆家，所有被遗忘和从未被正视的愧疚感全都复苏了。我从九年级起就拿着全额奖学金去寄宿学校读书，所以远离贫困对我来说并不新鲜。但我日益优渥的生活，却拉大了我与家人的距离。朋友们说我不该感到愧疚，他们问，在你这个年纪，又能为家里做些什么实质性的事呢？尽管我明白，接受教育是正确的选择，但有时仍忍不住觉得，自己的日子过得太好了。我没有理由享受安稳与温暖，而我的哥哥却要应对失业和偏见的可能。我也会遭遇偏见，但身处富裕的知识分子圈中，学生身份使我感受到的歧视柔和了许多。

More than my sense of guilt, my sense of helplessness increases each time I return home. As my success leads me further away for longer periods of time, poverty becomes harder to conceptualize and feels that much more oppressive when I visit with it. The first night of break, I lay in our bedroom, on a couch that let out into a bed that took up the whole room, except for a space heater. It was a little hard to sleep because the springs from the couch stuck through at inconvenient spots. But it would have been impossible to sleep anyway because of the groans coming from my grandmother's room next door. Only in her early 60s, she suffers from many chronic diseases and couldn't help but moan, then pray aloud, then moan, then pray aloud.

比起愧疚，我的无助感更是每回一次家便加深一层。我的成功让我离家越来越远，离家时间也越来越长，贫困因此变得愈发抽象，以至于每当回来探望，都觉得它愈发令人窒息。假期的第一晚，我躺在我们的卧室里，睡在一张由沙发拉开的床上，这张床几乎占满了整个房间，只留下一台电暖器的位置。沙发上好几处的弹簧都戳了出来，让人有点难以入睡。但无论如何，我都睡不着，因为隔壁外婆的房间里不时传来呻吟。她才六十出头，却身患多种慢性病，只能不住地呻吟，然后大声祈祷，接着又呻吟，又祈祷。

This wrenching of my heart was interrupted by the 3 A.M. entry of a relative who had been allowed to stay at the house despite rowdy behavior and threats toward the family in the past. As he came into the house, he slammed the door, and his heavy steps shook the second floor as he stomped into my grandmother's room to take his place, at the foot of her bed. There he slept, without blankets on a bare mattress. This was the first night. Later in the vacation, a Christmas turkey and a Christmas ham were stolen from my aunt's refrigerator on Christmas Eve. We think the thief was a relative. My mom and I decided not to exchange gifts that year because it just didn't seem festive.

凌晨三点，一个亲戚闯了进来，打断了我这揪心的痛楚。他过去曾有粗野行径，还威胁过家人，但还是被允许住在这里。他进屋时，“砰”地一声把门甩上，沉重的脚步声震得二楼地板都在晃。他大步踏进外婆的房间，在她床脚边自己的位置躺下，睡在一张光秃秃的床垫上，连条毯子都没有。这只是第一晚。假期后几天，圣诞前夜，我姨妈冰箱里的一只圣诞火鸡和一只火腿被人偷了。我们猜小偷是某个亲戚。那年，我和妈妈决定不互赠礼物了，因为实在没什么节日气氛。

A few days after New Year's, I returned to California. The Northeast was soon hit by a blizzard. They were there, and I was here. That was the way it had to be, for now. I haven't forgotten: the ache of knowing their suffering is always there. It has to be kept deep down, or I can't find the logic in studying and partying while people, my people, are being killed by poverty. Ironically, success drives me away from those I most want to help by getting an education.

元旦后没几天，我回到了加州。不久，一场暴风雪袭击了东北部。他们在那儿，我在这儿。眼下，只能如此。我没有忘记：深知他们的苦难就在那里，这种痛楚始终存在。我必须把它深埋心底，否则，当我的亲人正被贫困折磨致死时，我无法为自己的求学和派对找到任何合乎情理的解释。讽刺的是，我本想通过接受教育来帮助我最想帮助的人，但成功却驱使我离他们越来越远。

Somewhere in the midst of all that misery, my family has built, within me, "a proud feeling." As I travel between the two worlds, it becomes harder to remember just how proud I should be—not just because of where I have come from and where I am going, but because of where they are. The fact that they survive in the world in which they live is something to be very proud of, indeed. It inspires within me a sense of tenacity and accomplishment that I hope every college graduate will someday possess.

在那无尽的苦难之中，我的家人在我心中建立起一种“引以为豪的感觉”。当我穿梭于两个世界之间，有时会更难记起我该有多么自豪——不仅因为我的来处与去向，更因为他们的所在。他们能在所处的那个世界里生存下来，这件事本身就非常值得自豪。这在我心中激发出一种坚韧与成就感，我希望每一位大学毕业生有朝一日都能拥有这种感觉。

## Synthesis

**En**
 The article "Living in Two Worlds" by Marcus Mabry chronicles his experience as a Stanford University student from an impoverished background. During school breaks, he travels from the affluent, academic world of California back to his family's life of poverty in New Jersey. This stark contrast triggers intense feelings of guilt, helplessness, and shame. Mabry grapples with the painful paradox that his education, which is meant to be a tool to help his family, is also the very thing that physically and emotionally distances him from their daily struggles. Ultimately, he finds a source of profound pride not just in his own journey, but in the resilience and tenacity of his family, which inspires in him a deeper sense of purpose.

 本文《生活在两个世界》记录了作者马库斯·梅布里作为一名出身贫寒的斯坦福大学生的亲身经历。每逢假期，他从富裕的加州学术殿堂回到新泽西贫困的家中。两个世界间的巨大反差让他内心充满强烈的内疚、无助与羞愧。作者挣扎于一个痛苦的悖论中：他所接受的教育本应是帮助家庭的工具，却恰恰在物理和情感上将他与家人的日常苦难隔离开来。但最终，他不仅为自己的前行之路感到自豪，更从家人坚韧不拔的生存状态中汲取了力量，这份力量也激励着他，赋予他更深刻的使命感。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"My dreaded freshmen had been replaced by unemployed relatives; badgering professors had been replaced by hard-working single mothers, and cold classrooms by dilapidated bedrooms and kitchens."**

- 剖析： 这句话运用了精妙的平行结构（parallelism）和对比手法，以一针见血的方式揭示了作者所处的“两个世界”的本质差异。在斯坦福，他的烦恼是“dreaded freshmen”（让他头疼的新生）和“badgering professors”（不断催促、施压的教授），这些是学术生活中的“奢侈的烦恼”。回到家后，这些烦恼被残酷的现实所取代：“unemployed relatives”（失业的亲戚）、“hard-working single mothers”（辛勤工作的单身母亲）以及“dilapidated bedrooms and kitchens”（破旧的卧室和厨房）。通过这种“替换”，作者强调了校园里的问题在生存的重压面前显得何其微不足道，从而迅速将读者带入他所感受到的巨大现实冲击中。

2. **"Most students who travel between the universes of poverty and affluence during breaks experience similar conditions, as well as the guilt, the helplessness and, sometimes, the embarrassment associated with them."**

- 剖析： 此句的理解难点在于其高度的概括性和抽象性，尤其是“universes of poverty and affluence”这个比喻。作者没有说“两个地方”或“两种环境”，而是用了“universes”（宇宙），极大地夸张了贫与富之间的鸿沟，暗示这两个世界不仅在物质上天差地别，其运行法则、价值观和生活体验也完全不同，几乎无法互相理解，如同两个独立的宇宙。句子后半部分列出的三种核心情感——“guilt”（因自己享受优越条件而对家人产生的负罪感）、“helplessness”（面对家庭困境却无能为力的无助感）和“embarrassment”（有时因自己的贫困出身而感到的难堪），精准地概括了这类学生的共同心理困境。“associated with them” 指出这些情感是穿梭于两个“宇宙”时必然相伴而生的。

3. **"What frightens me most is not that the American socioeconomic system permits poverty to continue, but that by participating in that system I share some of the blame."**

- 剖析： 这是一个典型的“not... but...”结构，旨在强调后者。这句话深刻地揭示了作者的恐惧来源，其复杂性在于它从对社会系统的批判转向了对个人责任的拷问。作者恐惧的根源，**不是** “美国社会经济体系允许贫困持续存在”这一宏大而客观的社会问题（not that...），**而是** “我通过参与这个体系，也分担了部分罪责”（but that...）。他意识到，自己的成功——进入名校、追求优越生活——本身就是在这个“体系”内实现的。因此，他感觉自己不再是一个纯粹的旁观者或受害者，而是一个既得利益者，甚至在某种程度上成为了维系这个不公体系的同谋。这种从外部批判转向内疚自责的心理活动，是整篇文章情感挣扎的核心。

4. **"Using summer earnings, I added some expensive prints, a potted palm and some other plants, making the place look like the more-than-humble abode of a New York City Yuppie."**

- 剖析： 此句的难点在于理解“more-than-humble abode”这一带有反讽意味的表达以及“Yuppie”这个文化符号。“Yuppie”（雅皮士）指代“年轻、都市、专业”的人士，他们通常收入高、生活时尚，是80年代美国社会中产阶级精英的象征。“humble abode”是“寒舍”的谦称。而作者使用的“more-than-humble abode”（远超于“寒舍”的居所）是一种典型的曲言法（litotes），通过否定反面来表达肯定。它不是说“不那么简陋”，而是暗指自己的公寓经过装饰后已经变得相当漂亮、时髦，甚至有些奢侈，完全是“雅皮士”的风格。这句话以一种自嘲的方式，凸显了他正逐渐融入自己曾经陌生的富裕世界，这与他家乡的破败形成了鲜明对比。

5. **"As my success leads me further away for longer periods of time, poverty becomes harder to conceptualize and feels that much more oppressive when I visit with it."**

- 剖析： 这句话揭示了一个非常微妙且痛苦的心理悖论。句子的主干逻辑是：随着我的成功让我离开家乡越来越远、越来越久，两个矛盾的后果同时发生了。第一，“poverty becomes harder to conceptualize”（贫困变得更难概念化），意思是当贫困不再是他的日常时，它就变成了一个抽象的概念，而不是具体、真切的每日体验。第二，“feels that much more oppressive when I visit with it”（当我回去探访它时，感觉它更加压抑）。这里的“it”指代贫困，作者用了“visit with it” (探访它)，将其拟人化。这个悖论在于：正是因为与贫困的疏远，当他短暂地重新接触它时，其残酷和压迫感反而会因为强烈的反差而显得“that much more”（更加）令人窒息。熟悉会产生麻木，而疏远后的重逢则会加剧冲击。

6. **"This wrenching of my heart was interrupted by the 3 A.M. entry of a relative who had been allowed to stay at the house despite rowdy behavior and threats toward the family in the past."**

- 剖析： 此句的复杂性在于它将强烈的内在情感与混乱的外部现实浓缩在了一起。“wrenching of my heart”是一个极具表现力的比喻，意为“撕心裂肺般的痛苦”，形象地表达了作者听到祖母呻吟时的感受。而这痛苦的思绪被一个更混乱的现实打断了：一个亲戚的闯入。句子的后半部分是一个带有定语从句和介词短语的复杂修饰：“a relative who had been allowed to stay... despite rowdy behavior and threats...”。这个修饰成分至关重要，它点明了这个亲戚“过去尽管有粗暴行为和家庭威胁，却仍被允许留宿”。这揭示了家庭的另一种无助：他们深陷困境，以至于没有能力或没有选择去拒绝一个危险的家庭成员，只能被动地容忍他。这句话将作者的内心痛苦与家庭无法摆脱的混乱和危险处境紧密交织，极具冲击力。
