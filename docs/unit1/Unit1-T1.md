## Bilingual

It has been said that the English and the Americans are two great people separated by one language. The differences for which language gets blamed may not be due so much to words as to communications on other levels, beginning with English intonation (which sounds affected to many Americans) and continuing to ego-linked ways of handling time, space, and materials. If there ever were two cultures in which differences of the proxemic details are marked, it is in the educated (public school) English and the middle-class Americans. One of the basic reasons for this wide disparity is that in the United States we use space as a way of classifying people and activities, whereas in England it is the social system that determines who you are. In the United States, your address is an important cue to status (this applies not only to one's home but to the business address as well). The Joneses from Brooklyn and Miami are not as "in" as the Joneses from Newport and Palm Beach. Greenwich and Cape Cod are worlds apart from Newark and Miami. Businesses located on Madison and Park avenues have more tone than those on Seventh and Eighth avenues. A corner office is more prestigious than one next to the elevator or at the end of a long hall. The Englishman, however, is born and brought up in a social system. He is still Lord—no matter where you find him, even if it is behind the counter in a fishmonger's stall. In addition to class distinctions, there are differences between the English and ourselves in how space is allotted.

有种说法是，英国人与美国人是为同一种语言所隔阂的两个伟大民族。这种隔阂，常被归咎于语言本身，但其根源或许并不在于词汇，而在于更深层次的交流，比如英式语调（在许多美国人听来颇为矫揉造作），乃至处理时间、空间和物质时关乎自我的种种方式。若论世间哪两种文化的空间使用细节差异最为显著，那无疑是受过公学教育的英国人和美国中产阶级。造成这种巨大差异的根本原因之一在于，在美国，我们用空间来划分人群与活动；而在英国，决定你身份的却是社会体系。在美国，住址是地位的重要标志（这不仅适用于住宅，也适用于商业地址）。来自布鲁克林和迈阿密的琼斯家，自然不如纽波特和棕榈滩的琼斯家那般“时髦”。格林尼治和科德角，与纽瓦克和迈阿密相比，简直是天壤之别。坐落于麦迪逊大道和公园大道的公司，也比第七和第八大道的公司更显气派。一间转角办公室，比电梯旁或长廊尽头的办公室更具声望。然而，英国人是在其社会体系中生于斯、长于斯的。他依然是贵族——无论你于何处遇见他，哪怕是在鱼贩的摊位之后。除了阶级之分，英美两国在空间分配方式上亦有不同。

The middle-class American growing up in the United States feels he has a right to have his own room, or at least part of a room. My American subjects, when asked to draw an ideal room or office, invariably drew it for themselves and no one else. When asked to draw their present room or office, they drew only their own part of a shared room and then drew a line down the middle. Both male and female subjects identified the kitchen and the master bedroom as belonging to the mother or the wife, whereas Father's territory was a study or a den, if one was available; otherwise, it was "the shop," "the basement," or sometimes only a workbench or the garage. American women who want to be alone can go to the bedroom and close the door. The closed door is the sign meaning “Do not disturb” or “I'm angry.” An American is available if his door is open at home or at his office. He is expected not to shut himself off but to maintain himself in a state of constant readiness to answer the demands of others. Closed doors are for conferences, private conversations, and business, work that requires concentration, study, resting, sleeping, dressing, and sex.

在美国长大的中产阶级认为，自己有权拥有一间房，或至少是房间的一部分。我访谈的美国人，在被要求画出理想的房间或办公室时，无一例外只为自己而画。当被要求画出他们现在的房间或办公室时，他们只画出自己在共享空间中的那一部分，然后在中间画一道分割线。无论男女，都认为厨房和主卧属于母亲或妻子，而父亲的领地，若有的话，则是书房或工作室；否则，就是“工棚”“地下室”，有时甚至只是一个工作台或车库。美国女性想独处时，可以去卧室关上门。关着的门就是一种信号，意味着“请勿打扰”或“我生气了”。无论在家还是在办公室，只要门是开着的，就表示美国人愿意与人交流。人们期望他不要自我封闭，而是时刻准备好回应他人的需求。关门，则是为了开会、私下谈话、处理公务、专心工作、学习、休息、睡觉、更衣和私密生活。

The middle-and upper-class Englishman, on the other hand, is brought up in a nursery shared with brothers and sisters. The oldest occupies a room by himself which he vacates when he leaves for boarding school, possibly even at the age of nine or ten. The difference between a room of one's own and early conditioning to shared space, while seeming inconsequential, has an important effect on the Englishman's attitude toward his own space. He may never have a permanent "room of his own" and seldom expects one or feels he is entitled to one. Even Members of Parliament have no offices and often conduct their business on the terrace overlooking the Thames. As a consequence, the English are puzzled by the American need for a secure place in which to work, an office. Americans working in England may become annoyed if they are not provided with what they consider appropriate enclosed work space. In regard to the need for walls as a screen for the ego, this places the Americans somewhere between the Germans and the English.

另一方面，英国中上层阶级的人则是在与兄弟姐妹共处的育儿室里长大的。长子会独占一个房间，直到他离家去上寄宿学校时才空出来，而这可能早在他九、十岁时就发生了。拥有自己的房间，与从小就习惯共享空间，这两种经历看似微不足道，却对英国人看待个人空间的态度产生了重要影响。他可能从未拥有过一间固定的“自己的房间”，也很少奢望或认为自己有权拥有一间。即便是下议院的议员们也没有自己的办公室，常常在俯瞰泰晤士河的露台上处理公务。因此，英国人对于美国人需要一个安稳的工作场所——一间办公室——感到困惑。在美国人看来，若是得不到一个他们认为合适的封闭式工作空间，在英国工作的他们便会心生恼怒。就以墙壁作为自我屏障的需求而言，美国人恰好介于德国人与英国人之间。

The contrasting English and American patterns have some remarkable implications, particularly if we assume that man, like other animals, has a built-in need to shut himself off from others from time to time. An English student in one of my seminars typified what happens when hidden patterns clash. He was quite obviously experiencing strain in his relationships with Americans. Nothing seemed to go right and it was quite clear from his remarks that we did not know how to behave. An analysis of his complaints showed that a major source of irritation was that no American seemed to be able to pick up the subtle clues that there were times when he didn't want his thoughts intruded on. As he stated it, "I'm walking around the apartment and it seems that whenever I want to be alone my roommate starts talking to me. Pretty soon he's asking 'What's the matter?' and wants to know if I'm angry. By then I am angry and say something."

假使我们认定，人与其他动物一样，生来便有不时隔绝外在、寻求独处的需求，那么英美两国这种迥异的模式便会引申出一些值得深思的意味。我研讨班上的一位英国学生，其经历正是这种隐藏模式发生冲突时的典型写照。他与美国人相处时显然备感压力，事事不顺。从他的话语中可以清楚地听出，在我们美国人看来，他简直不知如何自处。分析他的抱怨后发现，一个主要的烦恼来源是，似乎没有一个美国人能领会那些微妙的暗示——即他有时不希望自己的思绪被打扰。正如他所说：“我在公寓里走来走去，好像每当我想独处时，我的室友偏要跟我说话。很快，他就会问‘怎么了？’，想知道我是否生气了。到那时，我可就真生气了，会说出些不好听的话来。”

It took some time but finally we were able to identify most of the contrasting features of the American and British problems that were in conflict in this case. When the American wants to be alone he goes into a room and shuts the door—he depends on architectural features for screening. For an American to refuse to talk to someone else present in the same room, to give them the "silent treatment," is the ultimate form of rejection and a sure sign of great displeasure. The English, on the other hand, lacking rooms of their own since childhood, never developed the practice of using space as a refuge from others. They have in effect internalized a set of barriers, which they erect and which others are supposed to recognize. Therefore, the more the Englishman shuts himself off when he is with an American the more likely the American is to break in to assure himself that all is well. Tension lasts until the two get to know each other. The important point is that the spatial and architectural needs of each are not the same at all.

经过一段时间的探讨，我们终于厘清了此案例中相互冲突的英美双方各自的问题所在。当美国人想要独处时，他会走进一个房间并关上门——他依靠建筑结构来隔绝外界。对于一个美国人来说，对同处一室的人不理不睬，施以“冷暴力”，是拒绝的极致表现，也是极度不悦的明确信号。而英国人，自小便缺少自己的房间，从未养成利用空间来躲避他人的习惯。他们早已在内心筑起了一道道屏障，并想当然地认为别人能够识别这些屏障。因此，当一个英国人与美国人共处时，他越是将自己封闭起来，美国人就越有可能闯入他的世界，以确认一切安好。这种紧张关系会一直持续，直到两人相互了解为止。关键在于，双方在空间和建筑上的需求全然不同。

## Synthesis

**En**
This article explores the profound cultural differences between the English and Americans, arguing that they extend beyond language to nonverbal communication, particularly the perception and use of space (proxemics). In the U.S., space is a primary indicator of social status (e.g., home address, office location), and personal privacy is achieved through physical separation, such as closing a door. Conversely, in England, social status is inherent and independent of location. Having been raised in shared spaces, the English develop "internalized barriers" to create psychological distance, expecting others to recognize these subtle cues for privacy even when in the same room. The text concludes that this fundamental divergence in spatial needs often leads to cross-cultural misunderstandings and tension.

 **Zh**
本文探讨了英美两国人民之间深刻的文化差异，并指出这种差异远不止语言层面，更体现在对空间（近身学）的感知和使用等非语言交流上。在美国，空间是社会地位的主要标志（如住址、办公室位置），而个人隐私则通过物理隔离（如关门）来实现。相反，在英国，社会地位是与生俱来且独立于所处环境的。由于自幼在共享空间长大，英国人发展出了一套“内在的屏障”，用以在心理上创造距离感，并期望他人在同一空间时能识别出这些需要独处的微妙信号。文章的结论是，这种在空间需求上的根本分歧，常常导致跨文化间的误解与紧张关系。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1.  **"The differences for which language gets blamed may not be due so much to words as to communications on other levels, beginning with English intonation (which sounds affected to many Americans) and continuing to ego-linked ways of handling time, space, and materials."**

-   剖析：这是一个典型的长句，其核心结构为 “The differences... may not be due so much to A as to B”（这些差异与其说是源于A，不如说是源于B）。
    -   **主干**：“The differences may not be due so much to words as to communications on other levels.”（这些差异与其说是词汇本身造成的，不如说是其他层面的交流方式造成的。）
    -   **定语从句**：“for which language gets blamed”（语言因此而受指责的那些差异）。
    -   **补充说明**：破折号后的部分 “beginning with... and continuing to...” 是对 “communications on other levels” 的具体举例说明。它列举了三个层面：1）“English intonation (which sounds affected to many Americans)”（英国人的语调，在许多美国人听来显得做作）；2）“ego-linked ways of handling time”（与自我意识相关的处理时间的方式）；3）“ego-linked ways of handling space, and materials”（与自我意识相关的处理空间和物品的方式）。“Ego-linked” 在此指与个人身份认同、自我边界感紧密相关的方式。
    -   **总结**：整句话的意思是，人们常将英美文化的差异归咎于语言，但真正的根源或许并不在于词汇，而在于更深层次的非语言交流，比如在许多美国人听来十分做作的英式语调，以及两种文化中与个人边界感息息相关的、处理时间、空间和物质的不同方式。

2.  **"If there ever were two cultures in which differences of the proxemic details are marked, it is in the educated (public school) English and the middle-class Americans."**

-   剖析：此句使用了虚拟语气（“if there ever were...”）来做出一个非常强烈的断言，这是一种强调手法。
    -   **结构**：“If..., it is...” 结构意为“如果要说...，那一定是...”。
    -   **核心概念**：“proxemic details” 指“空间关系学细节”或“人际距离学的细节”，即一个文化中人们如何使用和感知个人空间。
    -   **“marked”** 在此意为“显著的，明显的”。
    -   **文化特定词汇**：“public school” 在英国语境下特指收费高昂的私立精英公学，而非公立学校。
    -   **总结**：这句话用一种非常肯定的语气指出：如果要找出一对在人际空间使用细节上差异最为显著的文化群体，那无疑就是受过精英教育的英国人与美国的中产阶级。它为全文的论点设定了清晰的比较对象。

3.  **"In the United States we use space as a way of classifying people and activities, whereas in England it is the social system that determines who you are."**

-   剖析：这是一个对比鲜明的复合句，精准地概括了全文的核心论点。
    -   **“whereas”** (然而，但是) 连接了两个对立的观点。
    -   **前半句**：“In the United States we use space as a way of classifying people and activities”（在美国，我们用空间来划分人群和活动的等级）。这里的“classifying”指的不仅是分类，更是评判地位高低。
    -   **后半句**：“in England it is the social system that determines who you are”（在英国，决定你身份的是社会体系）。这里使用了 “it is... that...” 的强调句型，突出强调“the social system”（社会体系），即阶级、出身等。
    -   **总结**：此句通过直接对比，一针见血地指出了英美文化在价值观上的根本差异：美国文化用外在的、物质性的空间（如住址好坏）来定义一个人的地位；而英国文化则依赖于内在的、与生俱来的社会阶级来定义一个人的身份。

4.  **"He is still Lord—no matter where you find him, even if it is behind the counter in a fishmonger's stall."**

-   剖析：这句话通过一个极具戏剧性与反差感的例子来论证前文的观点。
    -   **核心论点**：“He is still Lord”（他依然是贵族），强调身份的恒定性。
    -   **让步状语**：“no matter where you find him”（无论你在哪里见到他）和“even if it is behind the counter in a fishmonger's stall”（即便是在鱼贩的摊位后面）。
    -   **隐喻与反差**：“Lord”（勋爵/贵族）代表着极高的社会地位，而 “fishmonger's stall”（鱼贩摊位）则代表着极为普通甚至卑微的劳动场景。将这两个意象并置，产生了强烈的冲击力，极其有力地说明了在英国文化中，社会地位是内在的、不可剥离的，它不因个人所处的物理环境或从事的职业而改变。

5.  **"The English, on the other hand, lacking rooms of their own since childhood, never developed the practice of using space as a refuge from others."**

-   剖析：此句的复杂性在于其语序和插入成分。
    -   **主干**：“The English... never developed the practice...”。
    -   **插入语**：“lacking rooms of their own since childhood”（从小就缺少属于自己的房间）是一个现在分词短语，作原因状语。它解释了主句行为（“never developed the practice”）发生的原因。正常语序可以理解为：“Because the English lacked rooms of their own since childhood, they never...”。
    -   **核心概念**：“using space as a refuge from others” 指“将空间用作躲避他人的避难所”。
    -   **总结**：这句话阐明了英国人空间观念的成因。它指出，正因为英国人（特指中上层阶级）自幼就习惯于共享空间、缺少私人房间，所以他们从未养成依靠物理空间来隔绝他人、寻求独处的习惯。这为后文提到的“内在屏障”作了铺垫。

6.  **"They have in effect internalized a set of barriers, which they erect and which others are supposed to recognize."**

-   剖析：这是一个高度抽象和比喻性的句子，揭示了英国人保护个人隐私的核心机制。
    -   **核心比喻**：“internalized a set of barriers”（内化了一套屏障）。“Internalize”指将外在规则或观念吸收为内在的、自觉的行为模式。“Barriers”（屏障/壁垒）是物理概念，这里被用作比喻，指代心理上的、社交上的“隔离墙”。
    -   **“in effect”** 意为“实际上，事实上”。
    -   **两个并列的定语从句**：两个“which”引导的从句都修饰“barriers”。第一个“which they erect”（他们自己建立起来），动词“erect”（竖立）延续了物理屏障的比喻；第二个“which others are supposed to recognize”（（按理说）别人应该能识别出来），点明了这种交流方式是基于一种文化默契，也暗示了跨文化交流失败的根源——美国人无法识别这种无形的屏障。
    -   **总结**：整句话的意思是，英国人实际上已经在内心建立起一套无形的屏障；这套屏障由他们自己“竖立”起来，并且他们想当然地认为别人应该能够察觉到。这句话生动地解释了英国人如何在不离开物理空间的情况下实现“独处”。
