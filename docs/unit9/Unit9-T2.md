Strange, the things that suddenly become fashionable. Take backpacking, for instance.

说来也怪，有些东西会突然就时髦起来。就拿背包旅行来说吧。

I know people who five years ago had never climbed anything higher than a tall barstool. Now you can scarcely name a mountain within three hundred miles they haven't hoofed up in their Swiss-made "waffle-stompers".

我认识一些人，五年前他们爬过最高的地方也就是酒吧的高脚凳了。可现在，方圆三百英里之内，你都很难说出哪座山没被他们穿着瑞士造的“华夫底”登山鞋踏遍。

They used to complain about the price of sirloin steak. Now they complain about the price of beef jerky (which is about three times that of Maine lobster in Idaho).

过去他们抱怨西冷牛排的价格，如今他们抱怨牛肉干的价格（在爱达荷州，牛肉干的价格差不多是缅因州龙虾的三倍）。

Their backpacking is a refined sport, noted for lightness. The gear consists of such things as silk packs, magnesium frames, dainty camp stoves. Their sleeping bags are filled with the down of unborn goose, their tents are made of waterproof smoke. They carry two little packets from which they can spread out a nine-course meal. One packet contains the food and the other a freeze-dried French chef.

他们的背包旅行是一项以轻巧著称的精致运动。装备包括丝绸背包、镁制支架、小巧玲珑的野营炉等等。他们的睡袋里填充的是未出世雏鹅的绒毛，帐篷是由防水的轻烟制成。他们带着两个小包，就能变出一桌九道菜的大餐。一个小包装着食物，另一个装着冻干的法国大厨。

Well, it wasn't like that back in the old days, before backpacking became fashionable. These latecomers don't know what real backpacking was like.

嗨，在背包旅行还没时髦起来的旧时光里，可不是这个样子的。这些后来者根本不知道真正的背包旅行是什么滋味。

The rule of thumb for the old backpacking was that the weight of your pack should equal the weight of yourself and the kitchen range combined. Just a casual glance at a full pack sitting on the floor could give you a double hernia and fuse four vertebrae. After carrying the pack all day, you had to remember to tie one leg to a tree before you dropped it. Otherwise, you would float off into space. The pack eliminated the need for any special kind of ground-gripping shoes, because your feet would sink a foot and a half into hard-packed earth, two inches into solid rock. Some of the new breed of backpackers occasionally wonder what caused a swath of fallen trees on the side of a mountain. That is where one of the old backpackers slipped off a trail with a full pack.

过去背包旅行的经验法则是，背包的重量应该等于你自身体重加上厨房炉灶的总和。光是瞥一眼放在地上的满载背包，就足以让你双双得了疝气，四节脊椎骨都粘连在一起。背着它走上一整天后，你得记得在卸包前把一条腿绑在树上，否则你就会飘向太空。这种背包让你无需任何特殊的防滑鞋，因为你的双脚会深陷进坚实的土地一英尺半，嵌入坚硬的岩石两英寸。有些新生代背包客偶尔会纳闷，山坡上那一片倒下的树木是怎么回事。那是一位老派背包客背着满载的行囊从山路上滑倒时造成的。

My packboard alone met the minimum weight requirement. It was a canvas and plywood model, surplus from the Second World War. These packboards apparently were designed with the idea that a number of them could be hooked together to make an emergency bridge for Sherman tanks. The first time you picked one up you thought maybe someone had forgotten to remove his tank.

单是我的背架就达到了最低重量要求。那是一款帆布胶合板的二战剩余物资。这些背架的设计理念显然是，将若干个拼接起来，可以为谢尔曼坦克搭起一座应急桥梁。你头一次拎起它时，会以为是不是有人忘了把他的坦克从里面弄出来。

My sleeping bag looked like a rolled-up mattress salvaged from a fire in a skid row hotel. Its filling was sawdust, horsehair, and No. 6 bird shot. Some of today's backpackers tell me their sleeping bags are so light they scarcely know they're there. The only time I scarcely knew my sleeping bag was there was when I was in it at 2 A.M. on a cold night. It was freckled from one end to the other with spark holes, a result of my efforts to stay close enough to the fire to keep warm. The only time I was halfway comfortable was when it was ablaze. It was the only sleeping bag I ever heard of which you could climb into in the evening with scarcely a mark on you and wake up in the morning bruised from head to toe. That was because two or three times a night my companions would take it upon themselves to jump up and stomp out my sleeping-bag fires—in their haste neglecting to first evacuate the occupant. Since I was the camp cook, I never knew whether they were attempting to save me from immolation or getting in a few last licks for what they thought might be terminal indigestion.

我的睡袋看上去就像从贫民窟旅馆的火灾中抢救出来的卷垫。填充物是锯末、马毛和6号鸟铳砂。今天的一些背包客告诉我，他们的睡袋轻若无物。我唯一一次感觉不到我的睡袋存在，是在一个寒夜的凌晨两点，我正躺在里面的时候。它从头到尾布满了火星燎出的洞，那是我为了取暖拼命靠近火堆的结果。我唯一感到还算舒服的时候，是它燃起熊熊大火之时。我这辈子就没听说过还有哪种睡袋，能让你晚上钻进去时身上毫发无伤，早上醒来时却遍体鳞伤。这是因为我的同伴们每晚总要两三次，自告奋勇地跳起来踩灭我睡袋上的火——他们一时情急，忘了先把里面的人弄出来。由于我是营地厨师，我真不知道他们是想救我免于火葬呢，还是想为他们自以为无药可救的消化不良讨回最后几拳。

Our provisions were not distinguished by variety. Dehydrated foods were considered effeminate. A man could ruin his reputation for life by getting caught on a pack trip with a dried apple. If you wanted apples, brother, you carried them with the water still in them. No one could afford such delicacies as commercial beef jerky. What you carried was a huge slab of bacon. It was so big that if the butcher had left on the legs, it could have walked behind you on a leash.

我们的给养谈不上种类繁多。脱水食物被认为是娘娘腔的玩意儿。要是在背包旅行时被人发现带了苹果干，那你这辈子就算名声扫地了。哥们儿，你要想吃苹果，就得背着那带水分的鲜苹果。谁也吃不起商品牛肉干那种奢侈品。你带的是一大块培根。那块培根巨大无比，如果屠夫没把腿剁掉，它都能拴上绳子跟在你身后走。

A typical meal consisted of fried bacon, potatoes and onions fried in bacon grease, a pan of beans heated in bacon grease, bacon grease gravy, some bread fried in bacon grease, and cowboy coffee (made by boiling an old cowboy in bacon grease). After meals, indigestion went through our camp like a sow grizzly with a toothache. During the night coyotes sat in nervous silence on surrounding hills and listened to the mournful wailing from our camp.

一顿典型的饭食包括：煎培根、培根油煎土豆和洋葱、培根油热豆子、培根油肉汁、培根油煎面包，还有牛仔咖啡（用培根油煮一个老牛仔熬出来的）。饭后，消化不良像一头牙疼的母灰熊在我们营地里肆虐。夜里，郊狼们紧张地静坐在周围的山丘上，聆听着从我们营地传出的阵阵哀号。

There were a few bad things, too, about backpacking in the old style, but I loved all of it. I probably would never have thought of quitting if it hadn't been for all those geophysical changes that took place in the Western Hemisphere a few years ago.

老派的背包旅行当然也有一些不好的地方，但我爱它的全部。要不是几年前西半球发生了那些地球物理变化，我可能永远都不会想到放弃。

The first thing I noticed was a distinct hardening of the earth. This occurred wherever I happened to spread out my sleeping bag, so I knew that the condition was widespread. (Interestingly enough, my children, lacking their father's scientific training, were unable to detect the phenomenon.)

我注意到的第一件事，是地球明显变硬了。这现象在我碰巧铺开睡袋的任何地方都会发生，所以我知道这情况是普遍性的。（有趣的是，我的孩子们因为缺乏其父那样的科学训练，未能察觉到这一现象。）

A short while later it became apparent to me that the nights in the mountains had become much colder than any I could remember in the past. The chill would sink its fangs into my bones in the pre-dawn hours and hang on like a terrier until the sun was high. I thought possibly that the drop in temperature was heralding a new ice age. Well, I could put up with the hard and the cold, but then the air started getting thinner.

不久之后，我明显感到山里的夜晚也比我记忆中冷得多了。黎明前，寒气会像利齿般刺入我的骨髓，像只小猎犬一样死咬不放，直到日上三竿。我心想，这气温骤降或许预示着一个新的冰河时代即将来临。好吧，坚硬和寒冷我尚能忍受，但接着空气也开始变得稀薄。

The only way you could get sufficient oxygen to lug a pack the size of an adolescent pachyderm was by gasping and wheezing. (Some of my wheezes were sufficient to strip small pine trees bare of their needles.) My trail speed became so slow it posed a dangerous threat to my person. If we were in fact at the onset of a new ice age, there was a good chance I might be overtaken and crushed by a glacier.

要想拖动一个像半大厚皮动物那么重的背包，唯一能获得足够氧气的办法就是大口喘气、呼呼作响。（我有些喘息声足以把小松树的针叶都给震落。）我的行进速度变得如此之慢，以至于对我的人身安全构成了危险的威胁。如果我们真的处在一个新冰河时代的开端，我很有可能被冰川追上并压垮。

The final straw was the discovery that a trail I had traveled easily and often in my youth had undergone a remarkable transformation. In the intervening years since I had last hiked it, the damn thing had nearly doubled in length. I must admit that I was puzzled, since I didn't know that trails could stretch or grow. The fact that it now took me twice as long to hike it, however, simply did not allow for any other explanation. I asked a couple of older friends about it, and they said that they had seen the same thing happen. They said probably the earth shifted on its axis every once in a while and caused trails to stretch. I suggested that maybe that was also the cause for the ground getting harder, the nights colder, and the air thinner. They said that sounded like a plausible theory to them. (My wife had another theory, but it was so wild and farfetched that I won't embarrass her by mentioning it here.)

压垮我的最后一根稻草是，我发现一条年轻时常走且走得轻松的小径，经历了一场惊人的蜕变。在我上次走过它之后的这些年里，这该死的小径长度几乎翻了一番。我必须承认我很困惑，因为我不知道小径还会伸长或生长。然而，我现在走完它要花双倍的时间，这个事实实在不容许有其他解释。我问了几个年长的朋友，他们说也见过同样的事情发生。他们说，大概是地球每隔一段时间地轴就会偏移，导致小径伸长。我提出，或许这也是地面变硬、夜晚变冷、空气变稀薄的原因。他们说这听起来像个貌似合理的理论。（我太太另有一套理论，但太过离奇荒诞，我就不在这里提了，免得让她难堪。）

Anyway, one day last fall while I was sitting at home fretting about the environment, a couple of friends telephoned and invited me along on a pack trip they were taking into the Cascades. Both of them are of the new school of backpacking, and I thought I owed it to them to go along. They could profit considerably by watching an old trail hand in action.

总之，去年秋天的某一天，我正坐在家里为环境忧心忡忡，两个朋友打来电话，邀请我一起去喀斯喀特山脉背包旅行。他俩都是新派背包客，我觉得我有义务跟他们一起去。观摩一位老手在野外如何行动，他们定能受益匪浅。

When I saw the packs R.B. and Charley showed up with, I almost had to laugh. Neither pack was large enough to carry much more than a cheese sandwich. I carried more bicarbonate of soda than they had food. I didn't know what they planned to sleep in, but it certainly couldn't be in those tidy little tote bags they had perched on top of their packs. Anyway, I didn't say anything. I just smiled and got out my winch and they each got a pry pole and before you knew it we had my pack out of the car and on my shoulders. As we headed up the trail, I knew it was going to be a rough trip. Already a few flakes of snow had fallen on my eyeballs.

当我看到R.B.和查理带着的背包时，我差点笑出声来。两个包都小得装不下一个芝士三明治。我带的小苏打都比他们的食物多。我不知道他们打算睡在什么里面，但肯定不会是他们放在背包顶上那些整洁的小手提袋里。无论如何，我什么也没说。我只是微笑着，拿出我的绞盘，他们一人拿一根撬棍，没一会儿工夫，我们就把我的背包从车里弄了出来，扛到我肩上。我们踏上小径时，我就知道这将是一趟艰难的旅程。已经有几片雪花落到我的眼球上了。

The environment on that trip was even harsher than I had remembered. The trails were steeper, the air thinner, the ground harder, the nights colder. Even my trail speed was slower. Several porcupines shot past me like I was standing still.

那次旅行中的环境比我记忆中还要严酷。山路更陡了，空气更稀薄了，地面更硬了，夜晚更冷了。连我的行进速度也更慢了。好几只豪猪从我身边飞驰而过，衬得我像站着不动似的。

R.B. and Charley showed obvious signs of relief when I made it into camp that first night.

第一天晚上我终于抵达营地时，R.B.和查理明显松了一口气。

"You probably thought I wouldn't make it with all the food," I chided them.

“你们大概以为我背着所有食物到不了吧，”我责备他们说。

"No," R.B. said. "It was just that for a moment there, we didn't recognize you. We thought we were being attacked by a giant snail."

“不，”R.B.说，“只是刚才那么一瞬间，我们没认出你来。我们以为自己被一只巨型蜗牛袭击了。”

I explained to them that we old-time backpackers made a practice of traveling the last mile or so on our hands and knees in order to give our feet a rest.

我向他们解释说，我们这些老派背包客有个习惯，最后的一英里左右会手脚并用爬着走，好让双脚休息一下。

It was disgusting to see them sitting there so relaxed and cheerful after a hard day's hike. They didn't seem to have any notion at all what backpacking was about. I could hardly stand it when they whipped out a little stove and boiled up some dried chunks of leather and sponge for supper. It probably would have hurt their feelings if I had got out the slab of bacon, so I didn't mention it. I just smiled and ate their food—four helpings in fact, just to make my act convincing. I never told them, but the Roast Baron of Beef was not quite rare enough for my taste, and they had forgotten the cream sauce for the asparagus tips. And I have certainly tasted better Baked Alaska in my day, too.

看到他们在辛苦跋涉一天后，竟然那么轻松愉快地坐着，真是令人作呕。他们似乎完全不懂背包旅行的真谛。当他们掏出一个小炉子，煮了些干巴巴的皮革和海绵块当晚餐时，我简直无法忍受。要是我拿出那块培根，可能会伤了他们的感情，所以我没提。我只是微笑着吃了他们的食物——实际上吃了四份，好让我的表演更逼真。我从未告诉过他们，那道烤牛脊肉对我来说不够嫩，而且他们还忘了给芦笋尖配奶油酱汁。另外，我这辈子肯定也吃过比这更好的烤阿拉斯加。

Well, they can have their fashionable new-school backpacking if they want it. I'm sticking with the old way. Oh, I'm making a few concessions to a harsher environment, but that's all. When I got back from that trip, I did order a new pack frame. It was designed by nine aeronautical engineers, three metallurgists, and a witch doctor, and weighs slightly less than the down of a small thistle. My new sleeping bag weighs nine ounces, including the thermostatic controls. If I want to sleep in, my new cook kit gets up and puts on the coffee. Then I bought a few boxes of that dried leather and sponge. But that's all. I'm certainly not going to be swept along on the tides of fashion.

好吧，他们要是喜欢，就去玩他们那套时髦的新派背包旅行好了。我坚守老派的方式。哦，我只是对更严酷的环境做出了一点让步，仅此而已。那次旅行回来后，我确实订购了一个新背架。它由九位航空工程师、三位冶金学家和一位巫医共同设计，重量比一小撮蓟花绒毛还轻。我的新睡袋重九盎司，还带温控装置。如果我想睡懒觉，我的新炊具会自己起来煮咖啡。然后我买了几盒那种干皮革和海绵块。但仅此而已。我绝不会被时尚的潮流席卷而去。

## Synthesis

**En**
 The narrator, a self-proclaimed "old-school" backpacker, humorously contrasts the arduous, traditional style of backpacking with the modern, fashionable, and high-tech approach. He depicts old-school backpacking as a grueling endeavor involving absurdly heavy packs and monotonous, greasy food, primarily bacon. In contrast, he portrays modern backpacking as a refined sport of ultra-light gear and gourmet freeze-dried meals. The central joke of the story is the narrator's comical attribution of his own age-related physical struggles—finding the ground harder, the air thinner, and the trails longer—to mysterious "geophysical changes," stubbornly refusing to acknowledge that he is simply getting older. The piece concludes with a powerful irony: after mocking the new school, he ends up purchasing all the latest, lightweight, high-tech equipment himself, all while claiming to be sticking to the "old way."

 **Zh**
 本文叙述者是一位自诩为“老派”的背包客，他用幽默的笔触，将艰苦的传统背包旅行方式与时髦、高科技的现代玩法进行了鲜明对比。他将老派背包旅行描绘成一场苦差事，需要背负重得离谱的行囊，吃着以培根为主的单调油腻食物。相比之下，现代背包旅行则是一项精致的运动，装备极致轻量，餐食则是冻干美食。全文的核心笑点在于，叙述者滑稽地将自己因年岁增长而遇到的身体困难——感觉地面变硬、空气变稀薄、山路变长——归咎于神秘的“地球物理变化”，固执地不愿承认自己正在变老。文章结尾极具讽刺意味：在嘲笑了新派玩法之后，他最终还是为自己添置了所有最新、最轻的高科技装备，同时却坚称自己仍然在坚守“老派传统”。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1.  **"My sleeping bag looked like a rolled-up mattress salvaged from a fire in a skid row hotel."**

    -   剖析： 这句话运用了一个生动且带有贬损意味的明喻（simile）来形容作者睡袋的破旧与劣质。“skid row”特指城市中那些龙蛇混杂、收容流浪汉和酗酒者的廉价旅馆区，即“贫民窟”。“salvaged from a fire”意为“从一场火灾中抢救出来的”。因此，整个比喻描绘的画面是：这个睡袋看起来就像是从贫民窟旅馆的火灾现场捡回来的、被烧得焦黑、破烂不堪的床垫。此句通过强烈的视觉想象，不仅夸张地强调了睡袋的沉重、肮脏和毫无舒适度可言，也暗示了老派背包客那种不拘小节甚至有些自虐的“硬汉”风格。

2.  **"Just a casual glance at a full pack sitting on the floor could give you a double hernia and fuse four vertebrae."**

    -   剖析： 此句是典型的夸张（hyperbole）手法，旨在用幽默的方式强调老式背包的惊人重量。“double hernia”（双侧疝气）和“fuse four vertebrae”（四节脊椎骨融合）都是严重的医学病症。作者说“仅仅是随意看一眼”地上的背包，就足以导致如此严重的身体损伤，这显然是不可能的。这种不合逻辑的因果关系正是其幽默感的来源。通过借用专业医学术语来描述一个日常情景，作者极其生动地向读者传达了背包的“致残级”重量，远比简单地说“背包很重”要形象和有力得多。

3.  **"Since I was the camp cook, I never knew whether they were attempting to save me from immolation or getting in a few last licks for what they thought might be terminal indigestion."**

    -   剖析： 这是一个结构复杂、充满黑色幽默的句子，表达了作者对自己厨艺的自嘲。当时的情景是：作者的睡袋着火了，同伴们跳起来猛踩。这句话的核心在于“whether A or B”结构，探讨同伴们的两种可能动机。
        -   A: “attempting to save me from immolation”（试图将我从自焚中拯救出来）。“Immolation”是一个很正式的词，指“献祭”或“（为理想）自焚”，用在这里夸大了火灾的危险性，是高尚的动机。
        -   B: “getting in a few last licks for what they thought might be terminal indigestion”（为他们自认为的晚期消化不良进行最后的报复）。“getting in a few last licks”是习语，意为“进行最后的攻击/报复”。“terminal indigestion”（绝症般的消化不良）则极度夸张地形容作者做的饭难吃到致命。
        这句话的精妙之处在于，它将一个舍己救人的高尚行为与一个因食物中毒而伺机报复的卑劣行径并置，让作者在两种截然相反的动机中揣测，从而产生了强烈的喜剧效果，讽刺了自己的厨艺有多么糟糕。

4.  **"After meals, indigestion went through our camp like a sow grizzly with a toothache."**

    -   剖析： 此句运用了一个极其传神的明喻（simile），来形容消化不良在营地的普遍性和严重性。作者将抽象的“indigestion”（消化不良）比作具体且极具威胁性的“a sow grizzly with a toothache”（一头患有牙痛的雌性灰熊）。这个比喻的妙处在于其层层递进的细节：首先，“grizzly”（灰熊）本身就代表着巨大和狂暴；其次，“sow grizzly”（母灰熊）通常被认为比公熊更具攻击性，尤其在保护幼崽时；最后，“with a toothache”（患有牙痛）给这头本就危险的野兽增添了烦躁、痛苦和不可预测的元素。因此，整个比喻描绘的不是简单的疼痛，而是一种巨大、狂躁、痛苦且极具破坏力的能量横扫整个营地的景象，形象地表现出所有人都因食物而痛苦不堪、哀嚎遍野的惨状。

5.  **"The only way you could get sufficient oxygen to lug a pack the size of an adolescent pachyderm was by gasping and wheezing."**

    -   剖析： 这句话再次使用了夸张和生僻词汇来制造幽默感。“lug”意为“费力地拖拉或搬运”，强调了背包的笨重。“pachyderm”是一个相对学术化的词，指大象、犀牛等“厚皮类动物”。作者没有简单地说背包“像大象一样重”，而是选择了更具体、更滑稽的“the size of an adolescent pachyderm”（一头青春期厚皮动物的大小）。这个说法不仅听起来更“有文化”，也增添了一种笨拙而仍在成长的荒诞感。整句话的意思是，要背着这样一个庞然大物，唯一能获取足够氧气的办法就是“gasping and wheezing”（大口喘气和发出哮鸣声），以此来生动描绘出因极度劳累而濒临窒息的状态。

6.  **"My wife had another theory, but it was so wild and farfetched that I won't embarrass her by mentioning it here."**

    -   剖析： 这句话是理解全文核心笑点的关键，运用了戏剧性反讽（dramatic irony）的手法。所谓戏剧性反讽，是指读者知道故事中角色所不知道的真相。在这里，作者将自己登山时感到的种种不适归咎于“地球物理变化”（地面变硬、空气变稀等）。他声称妻子的理论“wild and farfetched”（荒诞不经），并假惺惺地表示为了不让她“出丑”而不愿提及。然而，所有读者都能立刻明白，妻子的理论必定是那个最简单、最合理的解释：并非地球变了，而是作者自己老了、体力下降了。作者故作高深地否定这个显而易见的真相，并将其包装成对妻子的体贴，这种表里不一制造了强烈的反讽效果，是全文最幽默的“包袱”之一，深刻揭示了他固执、不服老又爱面子的可爱形象。

7.  **"I just smiled and ate their food—four helpings in fact, just to make my act convincing. I never told them, but the Roast Baron of Beef was not quite rare enough for my taste, and they had forgotten the cream sauce for the asparagus tips. And I have certainly tasted better Baked Alaska in my day, too."**

    -   剖析： 这段话充满了情景反讽（situational irony），揭示了叙述者言行与内心思想的巨大反差。他表面上为了“演得逼真”（make my act convincing），吃了四份他之前鄙夷的“新派”食物（冻干皮革和海绵）。然而，他内心的独白却暴露了他的真实面目：他并非一个只懂培根油脂的粗犷汉子，而是一个品味极其刁钻的美食家。他对“烤牛脊肉”的生熟度、“芦笋尖”是否配了奶油酱以及“火焰阿拉斯加蛋糕”的品质都颇有微词。这种反差极具讽刺性：一个吹嘘老派硬汉作风的人，其内心竟对高级料理有如此精细的要求，这彻底颠覆了他之前塑造的形象，产生了绝佳的喜剧效果，并暗示他其实对舒适和精致的生活充满向往。
