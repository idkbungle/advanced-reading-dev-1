Freedom's challenge in the Atomic Age is a sobering topic. We are facing today a strange new world and we are all wondering what we are going to do with it. What are we going to do with one of our most precious possessions, freedom? The world we know, our Western world, began with something as new as the conquest of space.

原子时代的自由所面临的挑战，是一个引人深思的课题。今日我们面临一个陌生而崭新的世界，人人皆茫然，不知何去何从。自由，我们最珍贵的财富之一，我们又将如何安顿它？我们所熟知的西方世界，其发端之新奇，堪比今日之征服寰宇。

Some 2,500 years ago Greece discovered freedom. Before that there was no freedom. There were great civilizations, splendid empires, but no freedom anywhere. Egypt, Babylon, Nineveh, were all tyrannies, one immensely powerful man ruling over helpless masses. In Greece, in Athens, a little city in a little country, there were no helpless masses, and a time came when the Athenians were led by a great man who did not want to be powerful. Absolute obedience to the ruler was what the leaders of the empires insisted on. Athens said no, there must never be absolute obedience to a man except in war. There must be willing obedience to what is good for all. Pericles, the great Athenian statesman, said: "We are a free government, but we obey the laws, more especially those which protect the oppressed, and the unwritten laws which, if broken, bring shame.”

约两千五百年前，希腊发现了自由。在此之前，世间本无自由。虽有伟大的文明，辉煌的帝国，却唯独不见自由的踪影。埃及、巴比伦、尼尼微，皆为暴政之邦，一人独揽大权，万民无助，任其宰割。而在希腊，在雅典这个蕞尔小邦中的一座小城里，却没有任人宰割的民众，并迎来了一位不慕权势的伟人来领导他们。帝国的统治者所坚持的，是臣民对君主的绝对服从。雅典却说：不，除非战时，否则绝不应绝对服从于任何个人，而应当心甘情愿地服从那有益于全体之事。伟大的雅典政治家伯利克里曾言：“我们是自由的政体，但我们遵守法律，尤其是那些保护弱者之法，以及那些不成文之法——违之，则招耻辱。”

Athenians willingly obeyed the written laws which they themselves passed, and the unwritten, which must be obeyed if free men live together. They must show each other kindness and pity and the many qualities without which life would be intolerable except to a hermit in the desert. The Athenians never thought that a man was free if he could do what he wanted. A man was free if he was self-controlled. To make yourself obey what you approved was freedom. They were saved from looking at their lives as their own private affair. Each one felt responsible for the welfare of Athens, not because it was imposed on him from the outside, but because the city was his pride and his safety. The creed of the first free government in the world was liberty for all men who could control themselves and would take responsibility for the state. This was the conception that underlay the lofty reach of Greek genius.

雅典人甘愿遵守他们自己通过的成文法，也遵守那些不成文的规约，因为自由人若要共处，就必须遵守它们。人与人之间必须展现仁爱、怜悯以及诸多美德，若无此，除非遁入荒漠的隐士，人生将苦不堪言。雅典人从不认为随心所欲便是自由。他们认为，能自我克制，方是自由之人。能躬行己所认同之理，这才是自由。这种观念使他们不致将个人生活仅仅视为一己私事。每一位公民都自觉为雅典的福祉负责，这并非外力强加，而是因为这座城邦是他的荣耀，也是他的庇护。世界上第一个自由政体的信条是：自由属于所有能够自律并愿为国家担责的人。希腊天才之所以能达到超凡的高度，其根基正在于此种观念。

But discovering freedom is not like discovering atomic bombs. It cannot be discovered once for all. If people do not prize it, and work for it, it will depart. Eternal vigilance is its price. Athens changed. It was a change that took place unnoticed though it was of the utmost importance, a spiritual change which penetrated the whole state. It had been the Athenians' pride and joy to give to their city. That they could get material benefits from her never entered their minds. There had to be a complete change of attitude before they could look at the city as an employer who paid her citizens for doing her work. Now instead of men giving to the state, the state was to give to them. What the people wanted was a government which would provide a comfortable life for them; and with this as the foremost object, ideas of freedom and self-reliance and responsibility were obscured to the point of disappearing. Athens was more and more looked on as a cooperative business possessed of great wealth in which all citizens had a right to share.

但自由的发现，不同于原子弹的发现，它并非一劳永逸之事。若民众不珍惜它、不为之奋斗，它便会悄然离去。永远的警醒，才是自由的代价。雅典变了。这是一场无人察觉却至关重要的变化，一场渗透了整个国家的精神蜕变。昔日，为城邦奉献，曾是雅典人引以为傲、引以为乐之事。从城邦获取物质利益，他们从未想过。必须等到人们的态度发生彻底转变，他们才会将城邦视为一个雇主，付钱让公民为之效力。如今，不再是人奉献于国，而是国施惠于人。民众所求，乃是一个能为他们提供安逸生活的政府；当此成为首要目标，自由、自立与责任的理念便日渐模糊，以至荡然无存。雅典越来越被视为一个合作社，坐拥巨富，所有公民皆有权分一杯羹。

She reached the point when the freedom she really wanted was freedom from responsibility. There could be only one result. If men insisted on being free from the burden of self-dependence and responsibility for the common good, they would cease to be free. Responsibility is the price every man must pay for freedom. It is to be had on no other terms. Athens, the Athens of Ancient Greece, refused responsibility; she reached the end of freedom and was never to have it again.

雅典最终所真正欲求的，是免于责任的自由。结果只能有一个。如果人们执意要摆脱自力更生和为公共利益负责的重担，他们终将不再自由。责任，是每个人为自由必须付出的代价，别无他途。古希腊的雅典拒绝了责任，于是，她的自由走到了尽头，并且永不复返。

But, "the excellent becomes the permanent," Aristotle said. Athens lost freedom forever, but freedom was not lost forever for the world. A great American statesman, James Madison, in or near the year 1776 A.D. referred to: "The capacity of mankind for self-government." No doubt he had not an idea that he was speaking Greek. Athens was not in the farthest background of his mind, but once a great and good idea has dawned upon man, it is never completely lost. The Atomic Age cannot destroy it. Somehow in this or that man's thought such an idea lives though unconsidered by the world of action. One can never be sure that it is not on the point of breaking out into action, only sure that it will do so sometime.

但亚里士多德说过：“卓越者，必将不朽。”雅典虽永失自由，但自由之于世界，却未永绝。公元1776年左右，伟大的美国政治家詹姆斯·麦迪逊曾提及“人类自治之能力”。无疑，他并未意识到自己所言乃是希腊思想的余绪。雅典或许未曾在他脑海的深处浮现，但一个伟大而美好的思想，一旦在人类心中破晓，就绝不会全然泯灭。原子时代也无法将其摧毁。纵然在现实世界中被忽视，这种思想却以某种方式活在某个人的思绪里。谁也无法断言它不会在某个时刻迸发为行动，唯一可以确定的是，它终有石破天惊的一日。

## Synthesis

**En**
 The article explores the profound meaning of freedom, using ancient Athens as a central case study to illustrate its rise and fall. It argues that true freedom is not the license to do as one pleases, but a disciplined state rooted in self-control, willing obedience to just laws, and a deep sense of responsibility for the common good. The decline of Athens serves as a cautionary tale, showing that when citizens shift their focus from contributing to the state to demanding entitlements from it—seeking "freedom from responsibility"—freedom itself is lost. However, the essay concludes on a hopeful note, asserting that the idea of freedom, once discovered, is permanent and can re-emerge, posing a perpetual challenge for humanity to uphold it.

 本文以古雅典的兴衰为核心案例，深入探讨了自由的深刻内涵。文章论证，真正的自由并非随心所欲的放纵，而是一种基于自律的状态，其根植于自我控制、对良法的自愿服从以及对公共福祉深切的责任感。雅典的衰落是一个警示：当公民的关注点从为国奉献转向向国索取，追求“免于负责的自由”时，自由本身便会消亡。然而，文章最后乐观地指出，自由的理念一经发现便会永存，能够再度重现，这也为人类提出了需要永远捍卫自由的挑战。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"We are a free government, but we obey the laws, more especially those which protect the oppressed, and the unwritten laws which, if broken, bring shame.”**

- 剖析： 这是古雅典政治家伯利克里的一句引言，结构精巧，内涵丰富。句子的主干是 “We are a free government, but we obey the laws... and the unwritten laws”。它首先通过 “but” 建立了一个对比关系，阐明“自由”与“守法”并非对立，而是共存前提。后半部分通过 “and” 并列了两种需要遵守的法：“the laws”（成文法）与 “the unwritten laws”（不成文法）。“more especially those which protect the oppressed” 是对成文法范围的强调，指出保护弱者是法律的核心要义之一。最精妙的是对“不成文法”的定义：“which, if broken, bring shame”。这里的“不成文法”指的是社会道德、公共良知和行为规范，违反它们不会受到法律的直接制裁，但会招致“耻辱”（shame），即来自社会舆论和个人良心的谴责。这句话深刻揭示了雅典式自由的精髓：它是一种高度自律的文明状态，既受成文法典的约束，更受内在道德感的指引。

2. **"To make yourself obey what you approved was freedom."**

- 剖析： 这是一个极具哲学思辨色彩的句子，它颠覆了人们对“自由”的通常理解。句子的主语是由不定式短语 “To make yourself obey what you approved” 充当的。“what you approved” 是一个名词性从句，指“你所认同和赞许的事物（如法律、道德准则）”。因此，整个主语的意思是“驱使自己去服从那些你内心认可的准则”。作者将这种行为定义为“freedom”（自由）。这句话的深刻之处在于，它将自由与“服从”联系起来，但这种服从不是被动的、强迫的，而是主动的、源于理性的。它强调了自由的内核是“自我控制”（self-control），是理性战胜欲望的过程。真正的自由不是放纵地“想做什么就做什么”，而是有能力“让自己去做那些自己认为正确和应该做的事”。这一定义与后文雅典人追求“免于责任的自由”形成了强烈反差。

3. **"Each one felt responsible for the welfare of Athens, not because it was imposed on him from the outside, but because the city was his pride and his safety."**

- 剖析： 此句通过 “not because... but because...” 的经典结构，深入剖析了雅典公民责任感的来源。它否定了第一种可能性：责任感并非“从外部强加的”（imposed from the outside）。这排除了君主专制下那种基于恐惧和强制的服从。它肯定了第二种可能性：责任感源于“城邦是他的骄傲与安全所在”（the city was his pride and his safety）。“pride”（骄傲）代表了公民对城邦的荣誉感、归属感和文化认同；“safety”（安全）则代表了城邦为公民提供的物理保护和稳定秩序。这句话点明了雅典民主的基石：公民的责任感是内生的、自发的，它建立在个人命运与城邦福祉紧密相连的认知之上。为城邦奉献，既是维护自己的荣誉，也是保障自己的根本利益，这种公私一体的观念是早期雅典强大的精神动力。

4. **"It was a change that took place unnoticed though it was of the utmost importance, a spiritual change which penetrated the whole state."**

- 剖析： 这句话描述了雅典衰落的根本原因，语言抽象但极具穿透力。句子的主干是 “It was a change... a spiritual change”。后半部分的 “a spiritual change” 是前半部分 “a change” 的同位语，起到了强调和解释的作用。“that took place unnoticed” 是一个定语从句，修饰 “change”，说明这种变化是“在不知不觉中发生的”，强调其隐蔽性和渐进性。“though it was of the utmost importance” 是一个让步状语从句，指出尽管此变化“至关重要”，但人们并未察觉。核心词是“spiritual change”（精神层面的变化），它点明雅典的衰亡并非始于外部入侵或经济崩溃，而是源于内部价值观和思想的蜕变。动词 “penetrated”（渗透）用得非常形象，生动地描绘出这种精神蜕变如同液体般无声无息地浸入了整个国家的肌体，影响了所有公民。

5. **"Athens was more and more looked on as a cooperative business possessed of great wealth in which all citizens had a right to share."**

- 剖析： 这是一个包含多层修饰的长句，其核心是一个揭示雅典社会心态异化的隐喻。句子的主干是 “Athens was looked on as a cooperative business”。隐喻的核心是将雅典城邦比作一个“合作企业”（cooperative business）。“possessed of great wealth” 是一个过去分词短语，作后置定语修饰 “business”，意为“一个拥有巨额财富的企业”。“in which all citizens had a right to share” 是一个定语从句，修饰 “great wealth”，进一步说明这个企业的性质是“所有公民都有权分享其财富”。这个比喻一针见血地指出了雅典人观念的转变：城邦不再是需要公民贡献和捍卫的命运共同体，而变成了一个可供瓜分的“公司”。公民的心态从“主人翁”和“建设者”沦为“股东”和“索取者”，他们关心的是如何从国家的财富中分得一杯羹，而不是如何为国家创造财富和承担责任。

6. **"If men insisted on being free from the burden of self-dependence and responsibility for the common good, they would cease to be free."**

- 剖析： 此句是一个条件状语从句，揭示了文章的核心悖论，极富哲理。从句 “If men insisted on...” 提出了一个假设条件。“being free from the burden of...” 指“摆脱……的负担”。这里的负担有两个：“self-dependence”（自力更生）和 “responsibility for the common good”（为公共利益承担责任）。这两种负担正是前文所说的真自由的基石。主句 “they would cease to be free” 指出了这种假设的必然结果：“他们将不再自由”。整个句子构成一个警世恒言：当人们执意追求一种“免于”承担责任和自力更生重负的“自由”时，他们恰恰会失去真正的自由。因为放弃责任，就意味着将决定权和权力让渡给某个能够“供养”他们的实体（政府或独裁者），最终必然导致被奴役的命运。责任与自由是一枚硬币的两面，不可分割。

7. **"Somehow in this or that man's thought such an idea lives though unconsidered by the world of action."**

- 剖析： 这句话表达了作者对自由理念不朽的信念，语言高度抽象和诗意。“Somehow” （不知何故，以某种方式）和 “in this or that man's thought”（在某个或某些人的思想中）共同描绘了理念存续的隐秘和不确定性，它可能并非主流，只是零星地存在。主干是 “such an idea lives”（这样一种思想存活着）。“though unconsidered by the world of action” 是一个让步状语从句的省略形式（省略了it is），意为“尽管在现实世界（或行动领域）中未被理会”。“the world of action”与“man's thought”形成对比，即“思想世界”与“现实世界”。这句话的意涵是，即使一个伟大的思想（如真正的自由）在现实政治和社会实践中被忽视或遗忘，它也绝不会真正消亡，它会像一颗种子，潜藏在某个思想者的脑海里，等待时机。这为文末的希望——自由理念终将重现——奠定了哲学基础。
