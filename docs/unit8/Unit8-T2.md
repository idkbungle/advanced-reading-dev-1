<center>The Philosopher and the Conqueror<center>
Gilbert Highet



Lying on the bare earth, shoeless, bearded, half-naked, he looked like a beggar or a lunatic. He was one, but not the other. He had opened his eyes with the sun at dawn, scratched, done his business like a dog at the roadside, washed at the public fountain, begged a piece of breakfast bread and a few olives, eaten them squatting on the ground, and washed them down with a few handfuls of water scooped from the spring. (Long ago he owned a rough wooden cup, but he threw it away when he saw a boy drinking out of his hollowed hands.) Having no work to go to and no family to provide for, he was free. As the market place filled up with shoppers and merchants and gossipers and sharpers and slaves and foreigners, he had strolled through it for an hour or two. Everybody knew him, or knew of him. They would throw sharp questions at him and get sharper answers. Sometimes they threw jeers, and got jibes; sometimes bits of food, and got scant thanks; sometimes a mischievous pebble, and got a shower of stones and abuse. They were not quite sure whether he was mad or not. He knew they were mad, all mad, each in a different way; they amused him. Now he was back at his home.

他躺在光秃秃的地上，赤着脚，蓄着须，衣不蔽体，看上去不是乞丐，就是疯子。他是前者，而非后者。他日出而醒，搔搔痒，像狗一样在路边方便，在公共喷泉边洗漱，讨来一片面包和几颗橄榄作早餐，然后蹲在地上吃了，再从泉水里掬几捧水喝下。（很久以前他有过一只粗陋的木杯，但当他看到一个男孩用并拢的双手掬水喝时，便将它丢弃了。）他无工可做，无家要养，了无牵挂。当市集里挤满了购物者、商人、说长道短者、骗子、奴隶和异乡人时，他已在其中闲逛了一两个钟头。人人都认识他，或听说过他。他们会向他抛出尖锐的问题，得到更尖刻的回答；有时抛来的是讥讽，换回的是嘲弄；有时是几块食物，换来寥寥的谢意；有时是一颗恶作剧的石子，招来一阵石块和咒骂。他们不大确定他究竟疯没疯。他却知道他们才是疯子，全都疯了，只是疯法各不相同；他觉得他们甚是有趣。现在，他回到了自己的家。

It was not a house, not even a squatter's hut. He thought everybody lived far too elaborately, expensively, anxiously. What good is a house? No one needs privacy: natural acts are not shameful; we all do the same things, and need not hide them. No one needs beds and chairs and such furniture. The animals live healthy lives and sleep on the ground. All we require, since nature did not dress us properly, is one garment to keep us warm, and some shelter from rain and wind. So he had one blanket—to dress him in the daytime and cover him at night—and he slept in a cask. His name was Diogenes. He was the founder of the creed called Cynicism (the word means "doggishness"); he spent much of his life in the rich, lazy, corrupt Greek city of Corinth, mocking and satirizing its people, and occasionally converting one of them.

那不是一座房子，甚至连一间棚屋都算不上。他认为人人都活得太过铺张，太过昂贵，太过焦虑。房子有什么好？没人需要隐私：天性之举并不可耻；我们做着同样的事情，无需遮遮掩掩。没人需要床榻、座椅之类的家具。动物们都活得健健康康，睡在地上。既然自然没有给我们蔽体的衣物，我们所需要的，不过是一件御寒的衣裳和一处遮风挡雨的庇护所。于是他只有一条毯子——白天裹身，夜里当被——睡在一个大瓮里。他名叫第欧根尼，是犬儒主义（此词意为“犬性”）的创始人。他一生中大部分时间都在希腊那座富庶、慵懒而腐败的城市科林斯度过，嘲讽讥刺那里的人们，偶尔也度化一两个。

His home was not a barrel made of wood: too expensive. It was a storage jar made of earthenware, something like a modern fuel tank—no doubt discarded because a break had made it useless. He was not the first to inhabit such a thing: the refugees driven into Athens by the Spartan invasion had been forced to sleep in casks. But he was the first who ever did so by choice, out of principle.

他的家不是木桶，那太贵了。它是一个陶制的储物瓮，有点像现代的储油罐——无疑是因为有了裂缝而被废弃的。他不是第一个栖身于此物的人：当年斯巴达入侵，逃难到雅典的难民就曾被迫睡在大瓮里。但他却是第一个出于自愿、源于信念而这么做的人。

Diogenes was not a degenerate or a maniac. He was a philosopher who wrote plays and poems and essays expounding his doctrine; he talked to those who cared to listen; he had pupils who admired him. But he taught chiefly by example. All should live naturally, he said, for what is natural is normal and cannot possibly be evil or shameful. Live without conventions, which are artificial and false; escape complexities and superfluities and extravagances, only so can you live a free life. The rich man believes he possesses his big house with its many rooms and its elaborate furniture, his pictures and his expensive clothes, his horses and his servants and his bank accounts. He does not. He depends on them, he worries about them, he spends most of his life's energy looking after them; the thought of losing them makes him sick with anxiety. They possess him. He is their slave. In order to procure a quantity of false, perishable goods he has sold the only true, lasting good, his own independence.

第欧根尼并非堕落之徒，也不是疯子。他是一位哲学家，著有戏剧、诗歌和文章来阐述他的学说；他与愿意倾听的人交谈；他还有仰慕他的门徒。但他身教胜于言传。他说，人人都应活得自然，因为自然的就是正常的，绝不可能是邪恶或可耻的。抛弃那些虚伪做作的习俗陈规；摆脱繁杂、冗余和奢侈，唯有如此，你才能活得自由。富人相信他拥有自己的大宅，里面有无数房间和精致家具，还有他的名画、华服、骏马、仆人和银行账户。其实不然。他依赖它们，为它们忧心，耗尽毕生精力去照料它们；一想到可能失去它们，就忧心如焚。是财物占有了他，他成了财物的奴隶。为了获取那些虚假易逝的物品，他出卖了唯一真实而永恒的美好——他自己的独立。

There have been many men who grew tired of human society with its complications, and went away to live simply—on a small farm, in a quiet village, in a hermit's cave, or in the darkness of anonymity. Not so Diogenes. He was not a recluse, or a stylite, or a beatnik. He was a missionary. His life's aim was clear to him: it was "to restamp the currency." (He and his father had once been convicted for counterfeiting, long before he turned to philosophy, and this phrase was Diogenes' bold, unembarrassed joke on the subject.) To restamp the currency: to take the clean metal of human life, to erase the old false conventional markings, and to imprint it with its true values.

有许多人厌倦了复杂的人类社会，选择离去，过一种简单的生活——在一个小农场，一个宁静的村庄，一个隐士的山洞，或是在籍籍无名的幽暗之中。但第欧根尼并非如此。他不是隐士，不是柱顶苦修者，也不是“垮掉的一代”。他是一名传道者。他的人生目标明确无误：那就是“重铸货币”。（早在他转向哲学之前，他和父亲曾因伪造货币而被定罪，这句短语便是第欧根尼对此事大胆而坦然的自嘲。）重铸货币：取来人生的纯净金属，抹去陈腐虚假的传统印记，再刻上它真正的价值。

The other great philosophers of the fourth century before Christ taught mainly their own private pupils. In the shady groves and cool sanctuaries of the Academy, Plato discoursed to a chosen few on the unreality of this contingent existence. Aristotle, among the books and instruments and specimens and archives and research-workers of his Lyceum, pursued investigations and gave lectures that were rightly named esoteric for those within the walls. But for Diogenes, laboratory and specimens and lecture halls and pupils were all to be found in a crowd of ordinary people. Therefore he chose to live in Athens or in the rich city of Corinth, where travelers from all over the Mediterranean world constantly came and went. And, by design, he publicly behaved in such ways as to show people what real life was. He would constantly take up their spiritual coin, ring it on a stone, and laugh at its false superscription.

公元前四世纪的其他伟大哲学家，主要教授自己的私人门徒。柏拉图在学院幽静的林荫和清凉的圣殿里，向少数被选中的人宣讲着此生此世的虚幻无常。亚里士多德则在他吕克昂学园的书籍、仪器、标本、档案和研究人员之中，进行着探索，发表着演说，这些演说被称为“秘传心授”，恰如其分。但对第欧根尼而言，实验室、标本、讲堂和学生，尽在芸芸众生之中。因此，他选择住在雅典或富庶的科林斯，地中海世界的旅人在此地络绎不绝，往来穿梭。他刻意在公众面前做出种种行为，以此向人们展示真实的人生为何物。他会时常拾起他们精神的钱币，在石头上敲响一听，然后嘲笑那虚伪的铭文。

He thought most people were only half-alive, most men only half-men. At bright noonday he walked through the market place carrying a lighted lamp and inspecting the face of everyone he met. They asked him why. Diogenes answered, "I am trying to find a man."

他认为多数人只是半死不活，多数男人只是半个男人。朗朗白日，他提着一盏点亮的灯笼穿过市集，审视着遇到的每一张面孔。人们问他为何如此。第欧根尼答道：“我在找一个真正的人。”

To a gentleman whose servant was putting on his shoes for him, Diogenes said, "You won't be really happy until he wipes your nose for you: that will come after you lose the use of your hands."

看到一个仆人正为主人穿鞋，第欧根尼对那主人说：“等到他为你擤鼻涕的时候，你才算真正快活了：那一天会在你双手尽失之后到来。”

Once there was a war scare so serious that it stirred even the lazy, profit-happy Corinthians. They began to drill, clean their weapons, and rebuild their neglected fortifications. Diogenes took his old cask and began to roll it up and down, back and forward. "When you are all so busy," he said, "I felt I ought to do something!"

一次，战争的恐慌来势汹汹，就连懒散安逸、唯利是图的科林斯人也被惊动了。他们开始操练，擦拭兵器，修葺废弃的防御工事。第欧根尼便将他的旧瓮来回地、上下来回地滚动。“看你们都这么忙，”他说，“我觉得我也该做点什么！”

And so he lived—like a dog, some said, because he cared nothing for privacy and other human conventions, and because he showed his teeth and barked at those whom he disliked. Now he was lying in the sunlight, as contented as a dog on the warm ground, happier (he himself used to boast) than the Shah of Persia. Although he knew he was going to have an important visitor, he would not move.

他就这样活着——有人说，像条狗一样，因为他毫不在意隐私及其他人情俗规，也因为他会对讨厌的人龇牙咧嘴、狂吠不已。此刻，他正躺在阳光下，像卧在暖地上的狗一样心满意足，比亚历山大大帝还要快乐（他自己常如此吹嘘）。尽管知道将有贵客来访，他却不肯动弹。

The little square began to fill with people. Page boys elegantly dressed, spearmen speaking a rough foreign dialect, discreet secretaries, hard-browed officers, suave diplomats, they all gradually formed a circle centered on Diogenes. He looked them over, as a sober man looks at a crowd of tottering drunks, and shook his head. He knew who they were. They were the attendants of the conqueror of Greece, the servants of Alexander, the Macedonian king, who was visiting his newly subdued realm.

小广场上渐渐挤满了人。衣着优雅的侍童，说着粗野外邦方言的长矛手，审慎的书记，眉头紧锁的军官，温文尔雅的外交官，他们渐渐围成一个圈，中心正是第欧根尼。他扫视着他们，如同一个清醒的人看着一群摇摇晃晃的醉汉，然后摇了摇头。他知道他们是谁。他们是希腊征服者的随从，是马其顿国王亚历山大的仆人，他正在巡视自己新征服的疆土。

Only twenty, Alexander was far older and wiser than his years. Like all Macedonians he loved drinking, but he could usually handle it; and toward women he was nobly restrained and chivalrous. Like all Macedonians he loved fighting; he was a magnificent commander, but he was not merely a military automaton. He could think. At thirteen he had become a pupil of the greatest mind in Greece, Aristotle. No exact record of his schooling survives. It is clear, though, that Aristotle took the passionate, half-barbarous boy and gave him the best of Greek culture. He taught Alexander poetry: the young prince slept with the Iliad under his pillow and longed to emulate Achilles, who brought the mighty power of Asia to ruin. He taught him philosophy, in particular the shapes and uses of political power: a few years later Alexander was to create a supranational empire that was not merely a power system but a vehicle for the exchange of Greek and Middle Eastern cultures.

亚历山大年方二十，心智与阅历却远超其年岁。与所有马其顿人一样，他酷爱饮酒，但通常能把握分寸；对女性则保持着高贵的克制和骑士风度。与所有马其顿人一样，他热爱征战；他是一位卓越的统帅，却不只是一架军事机器，他会思考。十三岁时，他师从希腊最伟大的思想家亚里士多德。他受教育的细节已无从考证，但很显然，亚里士多德接手了这个充满激情、半带蒙昧的少年，并赋予他希腊文化的精髓。他教亚历山大诗歌：年轻的王子枕着《伊利亚特》入眠，渴望效仿那摧毁了亚洲强权的阿喀琉斯。他教他哲学，尤其是政治权力的形态与运用：几年后，亚历山大将创建一个超民族的帝国，它不只是一个权力体系，更是希腊与中东文化交流的载体。

Aristotle taught him the principles of scientific research: during his invasion of the Persian domains Alexander took with him a large corps of scientists, and shipped hundreds of zoological specimens back to Greece for study. Indeed, it was from Aristotle that Alexander learned to seek out everything strange which might be instructive. Jugglers and stunt artists and virtuosos of the absurd he dismissed with a shrug; but on reaching India he was to spend hours discussing the problems of life and death with naked Hindu mystics, and later to see one demonstrate Yoga self-command by burning himself impassively to death.

亚里士多德教他科学研究的原理：入侵波斯领地期间，亚历山大带去了一大批科学家，并将成百上千的动物标本运回希腊供研究之用。确实，正是从亚里士多德那里，亚历山大学会了去探寻一切新奇而富有教益的事物。杂耍艺人、特技演员和荒诞派大师，他都只耸耸肩不屑一顾；但抵达印度后，他却花了好几个小时与赤身裸体的印度神秘主义者探讨生死问题，后来还看着其中一人镇定自若地自焚而亡，以展示瑜伽的自控之力。

Now, Alexander was in Corinth to take command of the League of Greek States which, after conquering them, his father Philip had created as a disguise for the New Macedonian Order. He was the man of the hour, of the century: he was unanimously appointed commander-in-chief of a new expedition against old, rich, corrupt Asia. Nearly everyone crowded to Corinth in order to congratulate him, to seek employment with him, even simply to see him: soldiers and statesmen, artists and merchants, poets and philosophers. He received their compliments graciously. Only Diogenes, although he lived in Corinth, did not visit the new monarch. With that generosity which Aristotle had taught him was a quality of the truly magnanimous man, Alexander determined to call upon Diogenes. Surely Diogenes, the God-born, would acknowledge the conqueror's power by some gift of hoarded wisdom.

此刻，亚历山大正在科林斯，准备接管希腊城邦联盟的总指挥权——这是他父亲菲利普征服各邦后，为掩饰马其顿新秩序而建立的。他是那个时代、那个世纪的风云人物：他被一致任命为新远征军的总司令，讨伐古老、富庶而腐败的亚洲。几乎所有人都涌向科林斯，为了祝贺他，谋求他的任用，甚至只为一睹其风采：军人与政客，艺术家与商人，诗人与哲学家。他优雅地接受了他们的赞美。唯有第欧根尼，虽然就住在科林斯，却没有前去拜见这位新君主。亚历山大秉持着亚里士多德教导他的宽宏大度——那是一个真正有气概的人的品质——决定亲自拜访第欧根尼。他想，这位神眷的第欧根尼，定会以其积攒的智慧为赠礼，来承认征服者的权威。

With his handsome face, his fiery glance, his strong supple body, his purple and gold cloak and his air of destiny, he moved through the parting crowd, toward the Dog's kennel. When a king approaches, all rise in respect. Diogenes did not rise, he merely sat up on one elbow. When a monarch enters a precinct, all greet him with a bow or an acclamation. Diogenes said nothing.

他面容英俊，目光炯炯，身躯矫健，身披紫金斗篷，周身散发着天命所归的气概。他穿过分开的人群，走向那“狗窝”。君王驾临时，众人皆起立致敬。第欧根尼没有起身，只是用一只手肘撑起了上身。君主驾临，众人无不鞠躬或欢呼致意。第欧根尼一言不发。

There was a silence. Some years later Alexander speared his best friend to the wall, for objecting to the exaggerated honors paid to His Majesty; but now he was still young and civil. He spoke first, with a kindly greeting. Looking at the poor broken cask, the single ragged garment, and the rough figure lying on the ground, he said, "Is there anything I can do for you, Diogenes?"

一片沉寂。数年后，亚历山大会因挚友反对臣下对他顶礼膜拜而将其一枪刺死在墙上；但此刻，他还年轻，还彬彬有礼。他先开口，友善地打了声招呼。他看着那破败的瓮、褴褛的衣衫和躺在地上的粗野身影，开口说道：“有什么我能为您效劳的吗，第欧根尼？”

“Yes,” said the Dog, “Stand to one side. You're blocking the sunlight.”

“有的，”那“狗”说道，“站到一旁去。你挡住我的阳光了。”

There was silence, not the ominous silence preceding a burst of fury, but a hush of amazement. Slowly, Alexander turned away. A titter broke out from the elegant Greeks, who were already beginning to make jokes about the Cur that looked at the King. The Macedonian officers, after deciding that Diogenes was not worth the trouble of kicking, were starting to guffaw and nudge one another. Alexander was still silent. To those nearest him he said quietly, "If I were not Alexander, I should be Diogenes." They took it as a paradox, designed to close the awkward little scene with a polite curtain line. But Alexander meant it. He understood Cynicism as the others could not. Later he took one of Diogenes' pupils with him to India as a philosophical interpreter (it was he who spoke to the naked sadhus). He was what Diogenes called himself, a cosmopolites, "citizen of the world." Like Diogenes, he admired the heroic figure of Hercules, the mighty conqueror who labors to help mankind while all others toil and sweat only for themselves. He knew that of all men then alive in the world only Alexander the conqueror and Diogenes the beggar were truly free.

又是一片沉寂，但并非暴怒前不祥的死寂，而是一片惊异的沉静。亚历山大缓缓转过身。那些文雅的希腊人发出一阵窃笑，他们已开始拿这条敢于直视君王的“恶犬”开起了玩笑。马其顿的军官们断定第欧根尼不值得费神去踹上一脚，便开始哄堂大笑，相互推搡。亚历山大依然沉默着。他对身边最近的人轻声说：“如果我不是亚历山大，我愿是第欧根尼。”他们将此话当成一句悖论，一句为这尴尬场面画上礼貌句号的收场白。但亚历山大是认真的。他不像旁人，他懂犬儒主义。后来，他带着第欧根尼的一名弟子去印度做哲学翻译（正是此人与那些赤身的苦行僧交谈）。他和第欧根尼自称的一样，是个“世界公民”。如同第欧根尼一样，他也敬佩英雄赫拉克勒斯，那位伟大的征服者，当众人只为自己劳苦流汗时，他却为拯救人类而奋斗。他知道，当时世上所有活着的人当中，只有征服者亚历山大和乞丐第欧根尼是真正自由的。

## Synthesis

**En**
 This article contrasts two prominent figures of ancient Greece, the philosopher Diogenes and the conqueror Alexander the Great, through the narrative of their famous encounter. It first details Diogenes' radical lifestyle of extreme minimalism and his Cynic philosophy, which rejects all social conventions and material possessions in pursuit of true, natural freedom. His mission was "to restamp the currency" of human values. The text then introduces the young, powerful, and wise Alexander, a conqueror educated by Aristotle. When all of Greece flocks to honor Alexander in Corinth, Diogenes remains indifferent. Intrigued, Alexander visits him. In their climactic exchange, Diogenes' only request is for Alexander to step out of his sunlight. Instead of being offended, Alexander profoundly remarks, "If I were not Alexander, I should be Diogenes," recognizing that both he, the master of the world, and Diogenes, the master of himself, were the only two truly free men alive.

 **Zh**
 本文通过叙述古代希腊两位杰出人物——哲学家第欧根尼与征服者亚历山大大帝的著名会面，对二者进行了鲜明对比。文章首先详细描述了第欧根尼抛弃一切社会习俗与物质财富、奉行极端简约主义的激进生活方式及其犬儒主义哲学，旨在追求真正、自然的自由，其人生使命是“重铸人类价值的货币”。随后，文章介绍了年轻、强大且充满智慧的征服者亚历山大，他曾受教于亚里士多德。当全希腊的人都涌向科林斯城向亚历山大表示敬意时，第欧根尼却无动于衷。亚历山大对此深感兴趣，亲自前去拜访。在这次堪称经典的会面中，面对亚历山大“我能为你做些什么”的提议，第欧根尼唯一的请求是让他“别挡住我的阳光”。亚历山大非但没有被冒犯，反而深刻地感叹道：“如果我不是亚历山大，我愿是第欧根尼。”他意识到，他自己——这个世界的主人，和第欧根尼——这个自我的主人，是当时世上仅有的两个真正自由的人。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1. **"The rich man believes he possesses his big house... They possess him. He is their slave."**

- 剖析： 这句话通过一次精妙的主宾倒置，深刻揭示了第欧根尼哲学中关于财富与自由的核心悖论。表面上看，是富人“拥有”（possess）房产、仆人和财富。但第欧根尼认为，事实恰恰相反，是这些物质财富“拥有”了富人。这种“拥有”体现在精神层面的奴役：富人必须耗费毕生精力去维护、担忧这些身外之物，对失去它们的恐惧让他备受煎熬，从而丧失了内心的安宁和真正的独立。因此，他不是财富的主人，而是成了它们的“奴隶”（slave）。这句话一针见血地指出了物质追求对人类精神自由的侵蚀。

2. **"To restamp the currency: to take the clean metal of human life, to erase the old false conventional markings, and to imprint it with its true values."**

- 剖析： 这句话是解读第欧根尼人生使命的核心隐喻。他将人生比作一枚“货币”（currency）。
    - “重铸货币”（to restamp the currency）是他对自己人生目标的概括，即要彻底改变和重塑当时社会的价值观。
    - “纯净的金属”（the clean metal of human life）比喻人与生俱来的、未被社会污染的自然本性。
    - “陈旧虚假的传统印记”（the old false conventional markings）指代社会强加于人的各种虚伪的规范、礼教、对名利财富的追求以及各种非自然的欲望。
    - “重新印上其真实价值”（to imprint it with its true values）则意味着要回归自然、简朴和自足，实现精神上的绝对独立，这才是人生的“真实价值”。
    这个比喻极为有力，因为它不仅形象，还与第欧根尼早年曾因制造伪币被定罪的经历形成一种大胆而无畏的自嘲，凸显了他挑战一切权威的性格。

3. **"He would constantly take up their spiritual coin, ring it on a stone, and laugh at its false superscription."**

- 剖析： 此句延续并发展了“货币”的隐喻，生动描绘了第欧根尼如何将他的哲学付诸实践。
    - “精神货币”（spiritual coin）指代人们所标榜的道德、品格或价值观。
    - “在石头上敲响它”（ring it on a stone）源于古代检验贵金属货币真伪的方法——真金白银敲击时声音清脆悦耳。在这里，比喻第欧根尼用他尖锐的言行和诘问，去考验和甄别人们品格的真伪。
    - “虚假的铭文/印记”（false superscription）指的是人们伪善的、浮于表面的言行举止。
    整句话构成一幅生动的画面：第欧根尼就像一个验币员，在人来人往的市集中，随时拿起一个人的“精神货币”进行检验，然后毫不留情地嘲笑其虚伪的本质，以此方式揭露和讽刺社会中的伪善。

4. **"Aristotle, among the books and instruments and specimens and archives and research-workers of his Lyceum, pursued investigations and gave lectures that were rightly named esoteric for those within the walls."**

- 剖析： 这是一个结构复杂的长句，通过环境描写和限定性从句，将亚里士多德的教学方式与第欧根尼的开放式传道形成鲜明对比。
    - 句子主干是“Aristotle... pursued investigations and gave lectures”。
    - 中间的长插入语“among the books and instruments and specimens and archives and research-workers of his Lyceum”通过罗列学术元素（书籍、仪器、标本、档案、研究员）和地点（吕克昂学园），营造出一种秩序井然、充满学术气息但又相对封闭的环境。
    - 后半句中的“esoteric”意为“深奥的、秘传的”，说明其课程内容艰深，不易理解。
    - “for those within the walls”（为那些在围墙之内的人）则明确指出了其教学对象的排他性——只面向少数经过筛选的精英学生。
    这句话通过复杂的句式结构，本身就传递出一种“学院派”的繁复与厚重感，与第欧根尼在公共场合、面向所有人的简单直接形成强烈反差，突显了两种哲学实践路径的根本不同。

5. **"A titter broke out from the elegant Greeks, who were already beginning to make jokes about the Cur that looked at the King."**

- 剖析： 这句话的理解难点在于“Cur”一词的双关用法，极具讽刺意味。
    - **表层含义**：“Cur”意为“恶狗”或“杂种狗”，是一个侮辱性词汇。希腊的权贵们用这个词来嘲笑第欧根尼衣衫褴褛、行为举止如同野狗，竟敢无礼地“看”国王。
    - **深层含义**：这个词巧妙地呼应了第欧根尼的哲学流派——“Cynicism”（犬儒主义）。“Cynic”一词源于希腊语“kynikos”，本意就是“像狗一样的”（dog-like）。第欧根尼欣然接受这个称号，并以像狗一样自然、无视人类习俗的方式生活为荣。
    - 因此，希腊人用以侮辱的“Cur”，恰恰点明了第欧根尼的哲学身份。这句话通过一个双关语，既展现了围观者的肤浅和不解，又在更高层面上肯定了第欧根尼哲学的本质。

6. **"If I were not Alexander, I should be Diogenes."**

- 剖析： 这句话是全文的高潮和点睛之笔，其深刻性远超其简单的语法结构。
    - **语法层面**：这是一个与现在事实相反的虚拟语气句（subjunctive mood），表达了亚历山大一个纯粹假设性的愿望。
    - **哲学层面**：这句话并非客套，而是亚历山大智慧的体现和对第欧根尼的最高敬意。亚历山大拥有世间一切的物质权力、财富和荣耀，达到了外在世界的顶峰；而第欧根尼则通过抛弃这一切，达到了内在精神自由的顶峰。亚历山大意识到，他们两人分别以截然相反的方式，抵达了“绝对自由”这一共同的终极境界。他承认，如果不存在“成为征服世界的亚历山大”这条路，那么“成为征服自我的第欧根尼”将是唯一值得选择的人生。这表明，真正的强者能够跨越身份和表象，识别并敬重另一种形式的伟大。
