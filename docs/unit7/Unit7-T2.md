<center>Another School Year-Why?<center>
John Ciardi



Let me tell you one of the earliest disasters in my career as a teacher. It was January of 1940 and I was fresh out of graduate school starting my first semester at the University of Kansas City. Part of the reading for the freshman English course was Hamlet. Part of the student body was a beanpole with hair on top who came into my class, sat down, folded his arms, and looked at me as if to say: "All right, damn you, teach me something." Two weeks later we started Hamlet. Three weeks later he came into my office with his hands on his hips. It is easy to put your hands on your hips if you are not carrying books, and this one was an unburdened soul. "Look," he said, "I came here to be a pharmacist. Why do I have to read this stuff?" And not having a book of his own to point to, he pointed at mine which was lying on the desk.

请允许我谈谈我教学生涯初期遭遇的一场“灾难”。那是在1940年1月，我刚从研究生院毕业，在堪萨斯城大学开始我执教的第一个学期。当时，大一英语课的阅读材料里有《哈姆雷特》。我的学生中，有一个头顶长着头发的竹竿似的小子，他走进教室，坐下，抱着双臂，那眼神仿佛在说：“行啊，你个该死的，教我点真本事看看。”两周后，我们开始读《哈姆雷特》。又过了三周，他双手叉腰地进了我的办公室。一个人如果不带书，自然可以轻松地把手叉在腰上，而他恰是个两手空空的家伙。“我说，”他开口道，“我是来学做药剂师的，凭什么要读这玩意儿？”因为自己没带书，他便指着我桌上的那本。

New as I was to the faculty, I could have told this specimen a number of things. I could have pointed out that he had enrolled, not in a drugstore mechanics school, but in a college, and that at the end of his course he meant to reach for a scroll that read Bachelor of Science. It would not read: Qualified Pill-Grinding Technician. It would certify that he had specialized in pharmacy and had attained a certain minimum qualification, but it would further certify that he had been exposed to some of the ideas mankind has generated within its history. That is to say, he had not entered a technical training school but a university, and that in universities students enroll for both training and education.

作为一名初来乍到的教员，我本可以跟这位仁兄理论一番。我本可以指出，他进入的不是一所药店技工学校，而是一所大学；他学业期满后希望拿到的是一张写着“理学学士”的文凭，而不是一张“合格的药剂研磨技师”证书。这张文凭会证明他专攻药学，并达到了某种最低资格要求，但它更会证明，他曾领略过人类历史进程中孕育出的某些思想精粹。也就是说，他进的不是一所技术培训学校，而是一所大学，在大学里，学生们既要接受培训，也要接受教育。

I could have told him all this, but it was fairly obvious he wasn't going to be around long enough for it to matter: at the rate he was going, the first marking period might reasonably be expected to blow him toward the employment agency.

我本可以将这些说与他听，但显而易见，他不会在这里待太久，跟他说是白费口舌。照他这个样子，第一次期中考试就足以让他卷铺盖走人，到职介所报到去了。

Nevertheless, I was young and I had a high sense of duty and I tried to put it this way: "For the rest of your life," I said, "your days are going to average out to about twenty-four hours. They will be a little shorter when you are in love, and a little longer when you are out of love, but the average will tend to hold. For eight of these hours, more or less, you will be asleep, and I assume you need neither education nor training to manage to get through that third of your life.

然而，当时我还年轻，怀着一股崇高的责任感，便试着这样对他说道：“在你接下来的人生里，”我说，“每一天平均都是二十四小时。热恋时，你会觉得光阴似箭；失恋时，你会感到度日如年，但平均下来，大抵如此。其中，大约有八小时，你是在睡梦中度过，我想，你无需任何教育或培训，就能安然度过这三分之一的人生。

"Then for about eight hours of each working day, you will, I hope, be usefully employed. Assume you have gone through pharmacy school or engineering, or aggie, or law school, or whatever—during those eight hours you will be using your professional skills. You will see to it during this third of your life that the cyanide stays out of the aspirin, that the bull doesn't jump the fence, or that your client doesn't go to the electric chair as a result of your incompetence. These are all useful pursuits, they involve skills every man must respect, and they can all bring you good basic satisfactions. Along with everything else, they will probably be what sets your table, supports your wife, and rears your children. They will be your income, and may it always suffice.

“然后，在每个工作日的八小时里，我希望你能从事一份有价值的工作。假如你读完了药学院、工程学院、农学院、法学院，或是其他什么学院——在这八小时里，你将运用你的专业技能。你生命中的这另外三分之一，将用来确保氰化物不会混进阿司匹林，公牛不会越出藩篱，又或是你的当事人不会因你的无能而被送上电椅。这些都是有益的追求，需要人人尊重的技能，也都能带给你基本的满足感。除此之外，它们很可能将为你养家糊口，抚育子女。它们是你的收入，愿它永远够用。

"But having finished the day's work, what do you do with those other eight hours—with the other third of your life? Let's say you go home to your family. What sort of family are you raising? Will the children ever be exposed to a reasonably penetrating idea at home? We all think of ourselves as citizens of a great democracy. Democracies can exist, however, only as long as they remain intellectually alive. Will you be presiding over a family that maintains some basic contact with the great continuity of democratic intellect? Or is your family life going to be strictly penny ante and beer on ice? Will there be a book in the house? Will there be a painting a reasonably sensitive man can look at without shuddering? Will your family be able to speak English and to talk about an idea? Will the kids ever get to hear Bach?"

“可当一天的工作结束，剩下的八小时——你生命中最后的三分之一，你又用来做什么呢？譬如，你回到家中。你将营造一个怎样的家庭？孩子们在家里能接触到一些有深度的思想吗？我们都自认为是伟大民主国家的公民。然而，民主制度的存续，全赖其思想的活力。你所主理的家庭，是会与民主思想的伟大传承保留一些基本联系呢，还是说你的家庭生活不过是小赌小闹，喝喝冰镇啤酒而已？家里会有一本书吗？会有一幅稍有审美情趣的人看了不至于发怵的画吗？你的家人能说一口得体的语言，并用它来探讨思想吗？孩子们能有机会听到巴赫的音乐吗？”

That is about what I said, but this particular pest was not interested. "Look," he said, "you professors raise your kids your way; I'll take care of my own. Me, I'm out to make money."

我大概就是这么说的，但这个令人头疼的家伙却不感兴趣。“我说，”他回应道，“你们教授用你们的方式教育孩子，我用我的方式管好我自己的。我嘛，是来赚钱的。”

"I hope you make a lot of it," I told him, "because you're going to be badly stuck for something to do when you're not signing checks."

“我希望你能挣很多很多钱，”我告诉他，“因为当你不签支票的时候，你会发现自己百无聊赖，不知何以为继。”

Fourteen years later, I am still teaching, and I am here to tell you that the business of the college is not only to train you, but to put you in touch with what the best human minds have thought. If you have no time for Shakespeare, for a basic look at philosophy, for the continuity of the fine arts, for that lesson of man's development we call history—then you have no business being in college. You are on your way to being that new species of mechanized savage, the Push-button Neanderthal. Our colleges inevitably graduate a number of such life-forms, but it cannot be said that they went to college; rather the college went through them—without making contact.

十四年后，我仍执教鞭，我在此想告诉你们，大学的职责不只是训练你们的技能，更是要让你们接触到人类最伟大的思想。如果你没有时间留给莎士比亚，没有时间对哲学进行基本的探寻，没有时间了解艺术的传承，没有时间学习那门我们称之为历史的人类发展课程——那么，你根本就不该上大学。你正走在通往一种新型的、机械化的野蛮人的路上——一种会按按钮的尼安德特人。我们的大学不可避免地会毕业一些这样的生命形态，但我们不能说他们上了大学；更确切地说，是大学“穿过”了他们——却未曾留下任何痕迹。

No one gets to be a human unaided. There is not time enough in a single lifetime to invent for oneself everything one needs to know in order to be a civilized human.

没有谁能不假外力就成为一个完整的人。短暂的一生，不足以让我们独自创造出成为一个文明人所需要知晓的一切。

Assume, for example, that you want to be a physicist. You pass the great stone halls of say, M.I.T., and there cut into the stone are the names of the master scientists. The chances are that few if any of you will leave your names to be cut into those stones. Yet any one of you who managed to stay awake through part of a high school course in physics knows more about physics than did many of those great makers of the past. You know more because they left you what they knew. The first course in any science is essentially a history course. You have to begin by learning what the past learned for you. Except as a man has entered the past of the race, he has no function in civilization.

举个例子，假设你想成为一名物理学家。你走过麻省理工学院巍峨的石砌讲堂，会看到石头上镌刻着科学巨匠们的名字。你们当中，恐怕很少有人能将自己的名字留在那石墙之上。然而，你们中任何一个只要在高中物理课上保持过清醒的人，都比过去许多伟大的先驱懂得更多的物理学知识。你之所以知之更多，是因为他们把所知传给了你。任何一门科学的第一课，本质上都是一门历史课。你必须从学习前人为你积累的知识开始。一个人唯有走进种族的过往，才能在文明中找到自己的位置。

And as this is true of the techniques of mankind, so is it true of mankind's spiritual resources. Most of these resources, both technical and spiritual, are stored in books. Books, the arts, and the techniques of science are man's peculiar accomplishment. When you have read a book, you have added to your human experience. Read Homer and your mind includes a piece of Homer's mind. Through books you can acquire at least fragments of the mind and experience of Virgil, Dante, Shakespeare—the list is endless. For a great book is necessarily a gift; it offers you a life you have not time to live yourself, and it takes you into a world you have not time to travel in literal time. A civilized human mind is, in essence, one that contains many such lives and many such worlds. If you are too much in a hurry, or too arrogantly proud of your own limitations, to accept as a gift to your humanity some pieces of the minds of Sophocles, of Aristotle, of Chaucer—and right down the scale and down the ages to Yeats, Einstein, E.B. White, and Ogden Nash—then you may be protected by the laws governing manslaughter, and you may be a voting entity, but you are neither a developed human being nor a useful citizen of a democracy.

这条真理既适用于人类的技术，也同样适用于人类的精神财富。这些财富，无论是技术的还是精神的，大多都储存在书籍之中。书籍、艺术和科学技术，是人类独有的成就。当你读完一本书，你便为自己的人生经验增添了新的维度。读荷马，你的思想便融入了荷马思想的一角。通过书籍，你至少可以撷取维吉尔、但丁、莎士比亚——这份名单无穷无尽——他们思想与经验的吉光片羽。因为一本好书必然是一份赠礼；它赠予你一段你没有时间亲历的人生，带你进入一个你没有时间亲至的世界。一个文明人的心智，本质上就是一个容纳了许多这样的人生、许多这样的世界的心智。如果你行色匆匆，或因自己有限的见识而沾沾自喜、狂妄自大，不愿接受索福克勒斯、亚里士多德、乔叟，乃至一路而下、贯穿古今的叶芝、爱因斯坦、E.B.怀特和奥格登·纳什等先贤智慧的馈赠——那么，即便有法律保护你的性命，你也可能只是一个投票的符号，但你既非一个健全发展的人，也非一个于民主社会有益的公民。

I think it was La Rochefoucauld who said that most people would never fall in love if they hadn't read about it. He might have said that no one would ever manage to become human if he hadn't read about it.

我想，是拉罗什富科说过，若非读过有关爱情的文字，大多数人恐怕永远不会坠入爱河。他或许还该说，若非读过有关人性的论述，没有人能真正成为一个人。

I speak, I am sure, for the faculty of the liberal arts college and for the faculties of the specialized schools as well, when I say that a university has no real existence and no real purpose except as it succeeds in putting you in touch, both as specialists and as humans, with those human minds your human mind needs to include. The faculty, by its very existence, says implicitly: "We have been aided by many people, and by many books, and by the arts, in our attempt to make ourselves some sort of storehouse of human experience. We are here to make available to you, as best we can, that experience."

我敢说，我不但代表着文理学院的全体同仁，也代表着所有专业院校的教师们。我想说的是，一所大学，若不能成功地让你们——无论是作为专才，还是作为完整的人——与那些你们的心智需要汲取的人类智慧相连，那它就既无存在的真实，也无存在的目标。我们这些教员，我们的存在本身，就在含蓄地言说：“在努力将自身打造为人类经验宝库的道路上，我们曾受惠于无数先贤、无数典籍与无数艺术。我们在此，就是要尽我们所能，将这些经验传授给你们。”

## Synthesis

**En**
 The author recounts an early teaching experience where a pharmacy student challenged the necessity of studying Shakespeare, arguing he was only there for vocational training. In response, the author explains that a university education is not just for one's eight-hour workday but for enriching the "other eight hours" of personal, family, and civic life. Years later, he reflects on this encounter and expands his argument: the true purpose of a college is to connect students with the greatest minds and ideas of human history. He warns that neglecting the humanities and arts in favor of pure technical skill creates a "Push-button Neanderthal"—a person who is technically competent but culturally and intellectually impoverished. Ultimately, he defines a civilized human as one whose mind has been broadened by the vicarious lives and worlds experienced through books and the arts, asserting that this is the essential gift a university offers.

 **Zh**
 作者讲述了自己早年的一段教学生涯：一名药剂学学生质问他为何要学习莎士比亚，认为自己上大学只是为了接受职业培训。作者回应道，大学教育不仅是为了装备人们应对每天八小时的工作，更是为了丰富另外八小时的个人、家庭和公民生活。多年后，作者回顾此事并深化其论点：大学的真正目的，是让学生接触人类历史上最伟大的思想。他警告说，若只重技术而忽视人文艺术，会培养出“按钮操作的尼安德特人”——一种技术上娴熟但在文化和思想上却贫乏的“新物种”。作者最后总结，一个文明人的心智，是通过书籍与艺术，容纳了无数种自己未曾亲历的人生与世界的，而这正是大学所能赋予的根本价值。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1.  **"It would certify that he had specialized in pharmacy and had attained a certain minimum qualification, but it would further certify that he had been exposed to some of the ideas mankind has generated within its history."**

-   剖析： 这句话结构精巧，通过两个平行的“it would certify that...”从句，清晰地界定了大学文凭的双重含义。第一个从句“he had specialized in pharmacy and had attained a certain minimum qualification”指代的是职业技能培训，即学生所追求的“术”。第二个从句则通过转折词“but”引出更深远的意义，即通识教育的价值——“被置于人类历史所产生的思想之中”（exposed to some of the ideas...）。这里的“exposed to”用词非常精妙，意为“接触”或“受到...的熏陶”，强调的不是精通，而是见识和启蒙。整句话通过对比，一针见血地指出了大学教育的本质：它不仅是职业资格的证明，更是一个人接触过人类智慧结晶的凭证。

2.  **"Will you be presiding over a family that maintains some basic contact with the great continuity of democratic intellect?"**

-   剖析： 此句的理解难点在于其高度抽象和正式的措辞。首先，“presiding over a family” (主导一个家庭) 是一个非常正式的表达，它将家庭的领导者角色提升到了近乎公共或机构负责人的高度，暗示了父母对家庭思想氛围的重大责任。句子的核心是抽象名词短语“the great continuity of democratic intellect”（民主思想的伟大延续性）。这并非指具体的政治知识，而是指支撑民主社会运行的、代代相传的理性思辨、批判性思维和人文关怀的传统。作者用这个宏大的概念质问学生，其家庭生活是否能与这一人类智识的“伟大传承”保持最基本的“联系”（basic contact），从而将个人修养与社会存续的宏大命题联系起来，极具思想冲击力。

3.  **"I hope you make a lot of it,' I told him, 'because you're going to be badly stuck for something to do when you're not signing checks.'"**

-   剖析： 这句话表面上是祝愿，实则是一句辛辣的讽刺和预言。难点在于理解“badly stuck for something to do”这一口语化表达的深层含义。它的字面意思是“会因找不到事做而陷入严重困境”。结合语境“when you're not signing checks”（当你不签支票/不忙于赚钱的时候），作者的言下之意是：如果你的人生只追求金钱，那么在工作和消费之外的闲暇时间里，你的精神世界将极度空虚，以至于无所适从，不知该如何打发时间。这句反语巧妙地重申了文章的主旨——缺乏内在精神世界的人，即使物质富裕，也无法获得真正的充实和幸福。

4.  **"You are on your way to being that new species of mechanized savage, the Push-button Neanderthal."**

-   剖析： 这是全文最具冲击力和创造性的隐喻之一。作者创造了两个矛盾组合的词语来批判缺乏人文素养的“专家”。“mechanized savage”（机械化的野蛮人）将“机械化”（代表现代技术文明）与“野蛮人”（代表原始、未开化）并置，形成一个悖论，精准地描绘出一种新型的人：他们能熟练操作现代设备，但在精神、文化和道德层面却处于原始状态。“the Push-button Neanderthal”（按钮操作的尼安德特人）是前者的生动具象化。“尼安德特人”是史前人类，代表着蒙昧；“按钮操作”则代表着现代社会最简单的技术行为。这个标签极具讽刺意味，意指那些只懂操作、不懂思考，拥有技术力量却缺乏人文精神的现代人，实际上是穿着文明外衣的“新原始人”。

5.  **"Our colleges inevitably graduate a number of such life-forms, but it cannot be said that they went to college; rather the college went through them—without making contact."**

-   剖析： 这句话的精髓在于其巧妙的文字游戏和深刻的隐喻。作者首先用冰冷的生物学词汇“life-forms”（生命形式）来指代这些毕业生，剥离了其“人”的属性，暗示他们并未成为完整的“人”。核心的对比在于“they went to college”（他们上了大学）和“the college went through them”（大学穿过了他们）。前者意味着学生作为主体，主动地参与、吸收和内化大学所提供的一切。后者则是一个颠覆性的表达，将学生描绘成一个被动的、中空的管道或筛子，知识和文化只是从他们身上流经过，却没有留下任何痕迹（without making contact）。这个比喻一针见血地揭示了无效教育的本质：学生仅仅是物理上存在于校园，却没有与大学的精神内核发生任何真正的“接触”或化学反应。

6.  **"A civilized human mind is, in essence, one that contains many such lives and many such worlds."**

-   剖析： 这句话是对“文明心智”的一个高度凝练的哲学定义，其理解有赖于上文的铺垫。作者在前文指出，书籍和艺术能让你“体验一种你没时间亲历的人生”（a life you have not time to live yourself），带你进入“一个你没时间亲身游历的世界”（a world you have not time to travel）。因此，这里的“many such lives”和“many such worlds”并非指现实中的生命和世界，而是指通过阅读和欣赏艺术而获得的无数种间接经验、多元视角和精神世界。这句话的深刻之处在于，它将“文明”定义为一种心智的容量和广度——一个文明人的头脑，本质上是一个装满了各种不同人生体验和世界图景的容器。这使得“文明”不再是一个空洞的标签，而是一种可以通过后天学习和体验来充盈的内在状态。
