<center>The Trial That Rocked the World<center>
John Scopes



1925年那个酷热的七月天，当我走上被告席时，拥挤的法庭里响起一阵嗡嗡的议论声。为我辩护的是著名刑事律师克拉伦斯·丹诺。而检方首席律师则是威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩——他口若悬河，曾三度被提名为美国总统候选人，也是基要主义运动的领袖，正是这场运动将我推上了被告席。

A buzz ran through the crowd as I took my place in the packed court on that sweltering July day in 1925. The counsel for my defense was the famous criminal lawyer Clarence Darrow. Leading counsel for the prosecution was William Jennings Bryan, the silver-tongued orator, three times Democratic nominee for President of the United States, and leader of the fundamentalist movement that had brought about my trial.

几周前，我还是田纳西州山区小镇代顿的一名无名教师，如今却卷入了一场举世瞩目的审判。法庭上，以哈佛大学的科特利·马瑟教授为首的十几位德高望重的教授与科学家已准备好为我作证。一百多名记者齐聚现场，甚至还有广播员——他们将史无前例地对一场陪审团审判进行实况转播。开庭前，丹诺一只手搭在我肩上， reassuringly 地低声说：“别担心，孩子，咱们会让他们见识几招的。”

A few weeks before I had been an unknown school-teacher in Dayton, a little town in the mountains of Tennessee. Now I was involved in a trial reported the world over. Seated in court, ready to testify on my behalf, were a dozen distinguished professors and scientists, led by Professor Kirtley Mather of Harvard University. More than 100 reporters were on hand, and even radio announcers, who for the first time in history were to broadcast a jury trial. "Don't worry, son, we'll show them a few tricks," Darrow had whispered throwing a reassuring arm round my shoulder as we were waiting for the court to open.

我以理科教师兼中学橄榄球队教练的身份来到代顿后不久，这场风暴便在我身边骤然爆发。多年来，基要主义者与现代派之间的冲突已是剑拔弩张。基要主义者固守《旧约》的字面解释，而现代派则接纳了查尔斯·达尔文的理论——即包括猴子与人类在内的所有动物，皆由共同的祖先进化而来。

The case had erupted round my head not long after I arrived in Dayton as science master and football coach at the secondary school. For a number of years a clash had been building up between the fundamentalists and the modernists. The fundamentalists adhered to a literal interpretation of the Old Testament. The modernists, on the other hand, accepted the theory advanced by Charles Darwin—that all animal life, including monkeys and men, had evolved from a common ancestor.

基要主义在田纳西州势力强大，州议会不久前刚通过一项法案，禁止教授“任何否认《圣经》所载创世说的理论”。这项新法案的矛头直指达尔文的进化论。一位名叫乔治·拉普利亚的工程师时常与当地人辩论，反对该法案。在一次争论中，拉普利亚说，教生物学不可能不教进化论。因为我当时教生物，他们便派人来找我。

Fundamentalism was strong in Tennessee, and the state legislature had recently passed a law prohibiting the teaching of "any theory that denies the story of creation as taught in the Bible." The new law was aimed squarely at Darwin's theory of evolution. An engineer, George Rappelyea, used to argue with the local people against the law. During one such argument, Rappelyea said that nobody could teach biology without teaching evolution. Since I had been teaching biology, I was sent for.

“拉普利亚说得对，”我告诉他们。

“Rappelyea is right,” I told them.

“这么说，你一直都在违法，”其中一人说道。

"Then you have been violating the law," one of them said.

“其他老师也一样，”我回答，“亨特的《公民生物学》里就解释了进化论，而那正是我们的教科书。”

"So has every other teacher," I replied. "Evolution is explained in Hunter's Civic Biology, and that's our textbook."

拉普利亚于是提议道：“咱们把这件事闹上法庭，看看它到底合不合法。”

Rappelyea then made a suggestion. "Let's take this thing to court," he said, "and test the legality of it."

5月7日我被起诉时，没人料到这案子会滚雪球般演变成美国历史上最著名的庭审之一，我本人更是始料未及。美国公民自由联盟宣布，如有必要，他们会把我的案子一直打到美国最高法院，以“确立教师有传播真理的权利而不必身陷囹圄”。接着，布莱恩自告奋勇协助州政府起诉我。消息一出，著名律师克拉伦斯·丹诺立刻主动请缨为我辩护。说来也讽刺，庭审前我并不认识丹诺，却在我上大学时见过布莱恩，他当时来做过一次演讲。我虽不赞同他的观点，却很钦佩他。

When I was indicted on May 7, no one, least of all I, anticipated that my case would snowball into one of the most famous trials in U.S. history. The American Civil Liberties Union announced that it would take my case to the U.S. Supreme Court if necessary to "establish that a teacher may tell the truth without being sent to jail." Then Bryan volunteered to assist the state in prosecuting me. Immediately the renowned lawyer Clarence Darrow offered his services to defend me. Ironically, I had not known Darrow before my trial but I had met Bryan when he had given a talk at my university. I admired him, although I did not agree with his views.

待到7月10日开庭时，我们这个仅有1500人的小镇已俨然成了一个大马戏场。主街两旁的建筑挂满了横幅。那座三层红砖法院周围，雨后春笋般冒出许多摇摇晃晃的货摊，贩卖着热狗、宗教书籍和西瓜。福音传教士们搭起帐篷，向路人布道宣讲。从周围山里来的人们，大多是基要主义者，他们前来为布莱恩助威，对抗那些“外来的异教徒”。起草反进化论法案的约翰·巴特勒也在其中。巴特勒是个49岁的农民，当选议员前从未离开过自己的家乡。

By the time the trial began on July 10, our town of 1,500 people had taken on a circus atmosphere. The buildings along the main street were festooned with banners. The streets around the three-storey red brick law court sprouted with rickety stands selling hot dogs, religious books and watermelons. Evangelists set up tents to exhort the passersby. People from the surrounding hills, mostly fundamentalists, arrived to cheer Bryan against the "infidel outsiders." Among them was John Butler, who had drawn up the anti-evolution law. Butler was a 49-year-old farmer who before his election had never been out of his native county.

主审法官是约翰·劳尔斯顿，一个面色红润的男人，他宣称：“俺就是个普普通通的山里法官。”布莱恩年事已高，大腹便便，协助他起诉的是他的儿子（也是一位律师）以及田纳西州才华横溢的年轻总检察长汤姆·斯图尔特。我的辩护律师团中，除了精明干练、68岁的丹诺，还有43岁英俊潇洒、富有魅力的达德利·菲尔德·马隆，以及沉静博学、深谙法律的阿瑟·加菲尔德·海斯。在这场宗教扮演关键角色的审判中，丹诺是不可知论者，马隆是天主教徒，而海斯则是犹太人。我的父亲也从肯塔基州赶来，陪我度过庭审。

The presiding judge was John Raulston, a florid-faced man who announced: "I'm jist a reg'lar mountaineer jedge." Bryan, ageing and paunchy, was assisted in his prosecution by his son, also a lawyer, and Tennessee's brilliant young attorney-general, Tom Stewart. Besides the shrewd 68-year-old Darrow, my counsel included the handsome and magnetic Dudley Field Malone, 43, and Arthur Garfield Hays, quiet, scholarly and steeped in the law. In a trial in which religion played a key role, Darrow was an agnostic, Malone a Catholic and Hays a Jew. My father had come from Kentucky to be with me for the trial.

法官请来一位当地牧师以祷告开庭，审判就此拉开序幕。十二名陪审员中，有三人除了《圣经》没读过任何书，还有一个是文盲。正如我父亲咆哮的那样：“这他妈的是个什么陪审团！”

The judge called for a local minister to open the session with prayer, and the trial got under way. Of the 12 jurors, three had never read any book except the Bible. One couldn't read. As my father growled, "That's one hell of a jury!"

就法律程序进行了一番初步交锋后，丹诺起身做开场陈述。“我的朋友，总检察长先生说，约翰·斯科普斯知道他为何在此，”丹诺拖长声调慢悠悠地说，“我也知道他为何在此。他在此，是因为愚昧与偏执正在大行其道，而这两者的结合是股极其强大的势力。”

After the preliminary sparring over legalities, Darrow got up to make his opening statement. "My friend the attorney-general says that John Scopes knows what he is here for," Darrow drawled. "I know what he is here for, too. He is here because ignorance and bigotry are rampant, and it is a mighty strong combination."

丹诺在酷热如烤箱的法庭里缓缓踱步。“今天是教师，”他继续说道，“明天就是杂志、书籍、报纸。久而久之，便是人与人反目，信仰与信仰为敌，直到我们倒退回十六世纪那‘光荣的年代’——那时，偏执狂们点燃柴堆，烧死那些敢于为人类思想带来智慧、启蒙与文明的勇者。”

Darrow walked slowly round the baking court. "Today it is the teachers," he continued, "and tomorrow the magazines, the books, the newspapers. After a while, it is the setting of man against man and creed against creed until we are marching backwards to the glorious age of the sixteenth century when bigots lighted faggots to burn the men who dared to bring any intelligence and enlightenment and culture to the human mind.”

他发言结束时，一个女人高声耳语道：“那个该死的异教徒。”

"That damned infidel," a woman whispered loudly as he finished his address.

第二天，检方开始传唤对我不利的证人。我的两个学生出庭作证，他们不好意思地朝我咧嘴笑，承认我教过他们进化论，但补充说他们并未因此受到毒害。霍华德·摩根，一个十四岁的聪明男孩作证说，我曾教过人是哺乳动物，和牛、马、狗、猫一样。

The following day the prosecution began calling witnesses against me. Two of my pupils testified, grinning shyly at me, that I had taught them evolution, but added that they had not been contaminated by the experience. Howard Morgan, a bright lad of 14, testified that I had taught that man was a mammal like cows, horses, dogs and cats.

“他没说猫和人是一回事吧？”丹诺问。

"He didn't say a cat was the same as a man?" Darrow asked.

“没有，先生，”那孩子说，“他说人有理性思维的能力。”

"No, sir," the youngster said. "He said man had reasoning power."

“关于这一点，我深表怀疑。”丹诺哼了一声。

"There is some doubt about that," Darrow snorted.

举证完毕后，布莱恩起身向陪审团陈词。他宣称，问题很简单，“基督徒相信人来自天上，而进化论者则相信人必来自地下。”旁听席上响起一阵轻笑，布莱恩越说越起劲。他一手挥舞着一本生物教科书，谴责那些来到代顿为辩方作证的科学家。

After the evidence was completed, Bryan rose to address the jury. The issue was simple, he declared, "The Christian believes that man came from above. The evolutionist believes that he must have come from below." The spectators chuckled and Bryan warmed to his work. In one hand he brandished a biology text as he denounced the scientists who had come to Dayton to testify for the defense.

“《圣经》，”他用洪亮如管风琴般的嗓音雷鸣道，“绝不会被那些不远千里而来的专家们赶出这座法庭，他们休想用那套将人类祖先追溯到丛林的进化论，来歪曲‘人乃上帝按其形象所造，为神圣计划之一部分，为特定旨意而降临于世’的真理。”

“The Bible,” he thundered in his sonorous organ tones, “is not going to be driven out of this court by experts who come hundreds of miles to testify that they can reconcile evolution, with its ancestors in the jungle, with man made by God in His image and put here for His purpose as part of a divine plan.”

他结束陈词时，下巴前伸，双目炯炯，听众席上爆发出雷鸣般的掌声和“阿门”的呐喊声。然而，总觉得少了点什么。当年布莱恩如草原之火席卷政坛时的那股猛烈激情，已荡然无存。人群似乎觉得，他们拥戴的斗士未能如人们所期望的那样，用他灼热的辩才去灼烧那些异教徒。

As he finished, jaw out-thrust, eyes flashing, the audience burst into applause and shouts of "Amen." Yet something was lacking. Gone was the fierce fervor of the days when Bryan had swept the political arena like a prairie fire. The crowd seemed to feel that their champion had not scorched the infidels with the hot breath of his oratory as he should have.

达德利·菲尔德·马隆霍地起身反驳。“有权为《圣经》代言的，并非只有布莱恩先生一人，”他说道。“这个国家还有许多人将毕生献给了上帝和宗教。而布莱恩先生，虽满怀激情与热忱，却将大半生都投身于政治。”马隆的声音越来越洪亮，布莱恩端起一壶水喝了一口。马隆呼吁思想自由，并指责布莱恩意图挑起一场科学与宗教的生死决斗。

Dudley Field Malone popped up to reply. "Mr. Bryan is not the only one who has the right to speak for the Bible," he observed. "There are other people in this country who have given up their whole lives to God and religion. Mr. Bryan, with passionate spirit and enthusiasm, has given most of his life to politics." Bryan sipped from a jug of water as Malone's voice grew in volume. He appealed for intellectual freedom, and accused Bryan of calling for a duel to the death between science and religion.

“真相从不与人决斗，”他吼道。“真相永远是赢家——我们无所畏惧。真相不需要布莱恩先生。真相是永恒的，不朽的，无需任何人为的力量来支撑！”

"There is never a duel with the truth," he roared. "The truth always wins—and we are not afraid of it. The truth does not need Mr. Bryan. The truth is eternal, immortal and needs no human agency to support it!"

马隆发言结束时，法庭里片刻静默。接着，爆发出比给布莱恩的掌声更为猛烈的喝彩。然而，尽管马隆赢得了与布莱恩的辩论，法官却裁定不允许科学家们出庭为辩方作证。

When Malone finished there was a momentary hush. Then the court broke into a storm of applause that surpassed that for Bryan. But although Malone had won the oratorical duel with Bryan, the judge ruled against permitting the scientists to testify for the defense.

休庭后，我们发现代顿的街上挤满了陌生人。小贩们在每个角落高声叫卖。一家商店打出广告：“达尔文在里面是对的。（这是J.R.达尔文服装百货店。）”一个生意人租下一个商店橱窗，用来展示一只猿猴。看客们付钱观赏，思索着自己是否与它沾亲带故。

When the court adjourned, we found Dayton's streets swarming with strangers. Hawkers cried their wares on every corner. One shop announced: "DARWIN IS RIGHT—INSIDE. (This was J.R. Darwin's Everything to Wear Store.)" One entrepreneur rented a shop window to display an ape. Spectators paid to gaze at it and ponder whether they might be related.

一位记者写道：“那可怜的畜生蜷缩在角落，双手蒙住眼睛，仿佛生怕那（亲缘关系）是真的。”

"The poor brute cowered in a corner with his hands over his eyes," a reporter noted, "afraid it might be true."

H.L.孟肯只穿着条裤子，让风扇对着他吹，奋笔撰写着火药味十足的报道。有人扬言要把他赶出小镇，因为他称当地市民为乡巴佬。二十二名电报员每天就这场审判发出十六万五千字的电讯稿。

H.L. Mencken wrote sulphurous dispatches sitting in his pants with a fan blowing on him, and there was talk of running him out of town for referring to the local citizenry as yokels. Twenty-two telegraphists were sending out 165,000 words a day on the trial.

由于天气炎热，且担心老旧的法庭地板会因不堪人群重负而坍塌，审判移到外面的枫树下继续进行。两千多名旁听者或坐在木凳上，或蹲在草地上，或栖身于停着的汽车顶上，或从窗口探头探脑地张望。

Because of the heat and a fear that the old court's floor might collapse under the weight of the throng, the trial was resumed outside under the maples. More than 2,000 spectators sat on wooden benches or squatted on the grass, perched on the tops of parked cars or gawked from windows.

接着，审判迎来了高潮。由于反进化论法案的措辞，检方被迫采取《圣经》必须按字面解释的立场。现在，丹诺亮出了他的王牌：传唤布莱恩作为辩方证人。法官大为惊愕。“我们传唤他作为《圣经》专家，”丹诺说，“他作为《圣经》权威的声望举世公认。”

Then came the climax of the trial. Because of the wording of the anti-evolution law, the prosecution was forced to take the position that the Bible must be interpreted literally. Now Darrow sprang his trump card by calling Bryan as a witness for the defense. The judge looked startled. "We are calling him as an expert on the Bible," Darrow said. "His reputation as an authority on Scripture is recognized throughout the world."

布莱恩对狡猾的丹诺心存疑虑，却无法拒绝这一挑战。多年来，他一直就《圣经》发表演讲、著书立说。甚至在反进化论法案通过前，他就在田纳西州开展了反达尔文主义的运动。他毅然走向证人席，手里的棕榈叶扇子仿佛一把利剑，用以击退敌人。

Bryan was suspicious of the wily Darrow, yet he could not refuse the challenge. For years he had lectured and written on the Bible. He had campaigned against Darwinism in Tennessee even before passage of the anti-evolution law. Resolutely he strode to the stand, carrying a palm fan like a sword to repel his enemies.

在丹诺平静的质询下，他承认自己相信《圣经》的字面意思，而人群则用热烈的“阿门”声为他挑衅的回答作注脚。

Under Darrow's quiet questioning he acknowledged believing the Bible literally, and the crowd punctuated his defiant replies with fervent “Amens.”

丹诺读起《创世纪》：“有晚上，有早晨，这是头一日。”然后他问布莱恩，是否相信太阳是在第四日创造的。布莱恩说是的。

Darrow read from Genesis: "And the evening and the morning were the first day." Then he asked Bryan if he believed that the sun was created on the fourth day. Bryan said that he did.

“没有太阳，何来早晨与黄昏？”丹诺问道。

"How could there have been a morning and evening without any sun?" Darrow enquired.

布莱恩默默地擦拭着他光秃秃的头顶。人群中传出窃笑声，就连那些虔诚的信徒也忍不住。丹诺一边转着眼镜，一边继续追问。他问布莱恩是否真的相信夏娃的故事。布莱恩给予了肯定的答复。

Bryan mopped his bald dome in silence. There were sniggers from the crowd, even among the faithful. Darrow twirled his spectacles as he pursued the questioning. He asked if Bryan believed literally in the story of Eve. Bryan answered in the affirmative.

“那你相信上帝惩罚蛇，命定它永生永世用肚子行走吗？”

"And you believe that God punished the serpent by condemning snakes for ever after to crawl upon their bellies?"

“我相信。”

"I believe that."

“那么，您是否知道，在那之前蛇是怎么走路的？”

"Well, have you any idea how the snake went before that time?"

人群哄堂大笑，布莱恩的脸色变得铁青。他的声音拔高，手中的扇子因愤怒而颤抖。

The crowd laughed, and Bryan turned livid. His voice rose and the fan in his hand shook in anger.

“法官大人，”他说，“我将一次性回答丹诺先生的所有问题。我希望全世界都知道，这个不信上帝的人，正利用田纳西州的法庭来诽谤上帝……”

“Your honor,” he said. “I will answer all Mr. Darrow's questions at once. I want the world to know that this man who does not believe in God is using a Tennessee court to cast slurs on Him...”

“我反对这个说法，”丹诺大喊，“我是在质询你那些地球上任何有头脑的基督徒都不会相信的愚蠢想法。”

“I object to that statement,” Darrow shouted. “I am examining you on your fool ideas that no intelligent Christian on earth believes.”

法官敲响法槌，平息了骚动，并宣布休庭至次日。

The judge used his gavel to quell the hubbub and adjourned court until next day.

布莱恩孤零零地站着，神情凄然。当旁听者们推开他，去和丹诺握手时，看着这位年迈的斗士，我心中不禁生出几分同情。

Bryan stood forlornly alone. My heart went out to the old warrior as spectators pushed by him to shake Darrow's hand.

第二天中午，陪审团被要求审议裁决。陪审员们只在草坪一角低声商议了九分钟。判决结果：有罪。我被处以一百美元罚款，并承担诉讼费用。

The jury were asked to consider their verdict at noon the following day. The jurymen retired to a corner of the lawn and whispered for just nine minutes. The verdict was guilty. I was fined 100 dollars and costs.

达德利·菲尔德·马隆称我的定罪是“一次胜利的失败”。一些南方的报纸，出于对他们那位光环褪去的斗士的忠诚，欢呼这是布莱恩的胜利。然而，布莱恩却在审判结束两天后，于悲伤和疲惫中在代顿辞世。

Dudley Field Malone called my conviction a "victorious defeat." A few Southern papers, loyal to their faded champion, hailed it as a victory for Bryan. But Bryan, sad and exhausted, died in Dayton two days after the trial.

他们提出让我重执教鞭，但我谢绝了。几位前来为我作证的教授为我争取到了芝加哥大学的奖学金，以便我能继续深造，攻读科学。后来，我成了一家石油公司的地质学家。

I was offered my teaching job back but I declined. Some of the professors who had come to testify on my behalf arranged a scholarship for me at the University of Chicago so that I could pursue the study of science. Later I became a geologist for an oil company.

不久前，我回到了代顿，这是我自37年前受审以来第一次回去。在我看来，小镇风貌依旧。但如今，一座山顶上建起了一所威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩大学，俯瞰着整个山谷。

Not long ago I went back to Dayton for the first time since my trial 37 years ago. The little town looked much the same to me. But now there is a William Jennings Bryan University on a hilltop overlooking the valley.

当然，也有其他变化。进化论如今已在田纳西州讲授，尽管当年给我定罪的那条法律依然在册。克拉伦斯·丹诺和达德利·菲尔德·马隆在代顿那间小法庭上掀起的雄辩风暴，如同一股清新的风，吹遍了美国各地的学校和立法机构，随之带来了一片思想自由与学术自由的新气象，且这股风气与日俱增，年胜一年。

There were other changes, too. Evolution is taught in Tennessee, though the law under which I was convicted is still on the books. The oratorical storm that Clarence Darrow and Dudley Field Malone blew up in the little court in Dayton swept like a fresh wind through the schools and legislative offices of the United States, bringing in its wake a new climate of intellectual and academic freedom that has grown with the passing years.

## Synthesis

**En**
This passage, narrated from the first-person perspective of defendant John Scopes, recounts the sensational 1925 "Monkey Trial." Scopes, a schoolteacher, was charged with violating a Tennessee state law that forbade teaching any theory contradicting the biblical story of creation, specifically Darwin's theory of evolution. The trial escalated into a major national confrontation between religious fundamentalism, represented by prosecutor William Jennings Bryan, and modern science and intellectual freedom, championed by defense attorney Clarence Darrow. The text vividly portrays the circus-like atmosphere of the trial and focuses on the climax: Darrow's brilliant cross-examination of Bryan, which exposed the contradictions of a literal interpretation of the Bible and resulted in Bryan's public humiliation. Although Scopes was ultimately found guilty, the author frames it as a "victorious defeat" that became a catalyst for advancing academic and intellectual freedom in the United States.

**Zh**
本文以被告约翰·斯科普斯的第一人称视角，记述了1925年轰动一时的“猴子审判”。作为一名教师，斯科普斯因教授达尔文的进化论，违反了田纳西州禁止教授任何与《圣经》创世论相悖理论的法律而受到指控。这场审判升级为一场全国性的重大对决，一方是以检察官威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩为代表的宗教原教旨主义，另一方是由辩护律师克拉伦斯·丹诺所倡导的现代科学与思想自由。文章生动描绘了审判现场马戏团般的喧闹氛围，并着重叙述了庭审高潮——丹诺对布莱恩的精彩盘问，此举不仅揭示了对《圣经》进行字面解读的内在矛盾，也令布莱恩当庭受辱。尽管斯科普斯最终被判有罪，但作者将其定性为一次“胜利的失败”，因为它极大地促进了美国学术与思想自由的发展。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1.  **"My case would snowball into one of the most famous trials in U.S. history."**

    -   **剖析**： 此句的理解难点在于动词短语“snowball into”。“Snowball”作名词是“雪球”，作动词则生动地描述了事物像滚雪球一样，规模、影响或重要性迅速且持续扩大的过程。这里，作者用这个词形象地表达了他的案件本是一件地方性的小事，却出乎意料地迅速发酵、升级，其影响力和关注度越滚越大，最终演变成了美国历史上最著名的审判之一。它强调了事态发展的失控性和戏剧性。

2.  **"After a while, it is the setting of man against man and creed against creed until we are marching backwards to the glorious age of the sixteenth century when bigots lighted faggots to burn the men who dared to bring any intelligence and enlightenment and culture to the human mind.”**

    -   **剖析**： 这是辩护律师丹诺一段极具煽动性和批判性的陈词，其理解难度在于其复杂的结构、强烈的反讽和深刻的历史影射。
        -   **结构与逻辑**： 这是一个典型的“滑坡谬误”论证，丹诺警告说，压制教授进化论这一行为，将会导致一系列更坏的后果（it is the setting of man against man and creed against creed），最终将社会带向倒退（until we are marching backwards）。
        -   **反讽手法**：“glorious age of the sixteenth century”（辉煌的十六世纪）是强烈的反讽。丹诺所指的并非一个真正光荣的时代，而是指中世纪末期欧洲宗教裁判所（Inquisition）盛行的黑暗时期，当时教会残酷迫害异端和科学先驱。
        -   **历史影射与意象**：“when bigots lighted faggots to burn the men...” 直接描绘了“偏执的狂热分子点燃柴堆，烧死那些敢于为人类思想带来智慧、启蒙和文化的人”。这幅画面直接指向了像布鲁诺那样因挑战教会权威而被处以火刑的历史人物。通过这个具体的、令人不寒而栗的意象，丹诺将禁止进化论的行为与历史上最野蛮、最反智的暴行联系起来，极具震撼力。
        -   **核心**：整句话旨在警告陪审团和公众，对思想的压制一旦开始，就不会停止，最终将摧毁一切文明与进步，使社会倒退回宗教狂热的黑暗时代。

3.  **"Gone was the fierce fervor of the days when Bryan had swept the political arena like a prairie fire."**

    -   **剖析**： 此句的难点在于其倒装结构和生动的比喻。“Gone was the fierce fervor”是完全倒装句，正常语序是“The fierce fervor...was gone”。这种倒装结构将“Gone”（消失了）置于句首，极大地强调了“荡然无存”的失落感和今非昔比的强烈对比。后半部分的“when Bryan had swept the political arena like a prairie fire”是一个比喻，将布莱恩年轻时在政治舞台上的巨大影响力比作“燎原的野火”，形容其势不可挡、充满激情和毁灭性的力量。整句话通过今昔对比，精炼地描绘出布莱恩英雄迟暮、风光不再的悲凉景象，暗示他的时代已经过去。

4.  **"The crowd seemed to feel that their champion had not scorched the infidels with the hot breath of his oratory as he should have."**

    -   **剖析**： 此句的难点在于其一连串的隐喻，生动地描绘了观众对布莱恩表现的失望。
        -   “Their champion”指布莱恩，他是原教旨主义者心目中的“捍卫者”或“冠军”。
        -   “Scorched the infidels”是一个强烈的隐喻。“Infidels”（异教徒）指丹诺一方的科学家和支持者。“Scorched”（烧焦、烤焦）在此意为用言辞进行猛烈、毁灭性的攻击。
        -   “with the hot breath of his oratory”是另一个隐喻，将布莱恩的“oratory”（演讲术）比作能喷出“hot breath”（灼热气息）的武器（如同龙息），本应能摧毁对手。
        -   综合来看，这句话的意思是：人群似乎感觉到，他们的捍卫者（布莱恩）并没能像他们所期望的那样，用他那本应如烈焰般灼人的辩才，来狠狠地痛击、摧毁那些“异教徒”。这句话精准地捕捉到了支持者们那种“恨铁不成钢”的失望情绪。

5.  **"H.L. Mencken wrote sulphurous dispatches sitting in his pants with a fan blowing on him, and there was talk of running him out of town for referring to the local citizenry as yokels."**

    -   **剖析**： 此句通过细节描写刻画了当时一位著名记者的形象及其与当地人的紧张关系，难点在于理解“sulphurous dispatches”和“yokels”。
        -   “Sulphurous dispatches”：“Sulphur”是硫磺，在西方文化中常与地狱、魔鬼和诅咒联系在一起。“Sulphurous”在此处为比喻用法，形容记者孟肯（H.L. Mencken）发回的报道“尖酸刻薄、充满火药味、措辞恶毒”。
        -   “sitting in his pants”：这是一个非常口语化和生动的细节，意为“只穿着裤子”，强调了天气酷热以及孟肯不拘小节、蔑视当地保守风气的态度。
        -   “yokels”：这是一个贬义词，指“乡巴佬、土包子”，带有强烈的鄙视意味。
        -   **整体**：这句话描绘了一幅生动的画面：记者孟肯在酷热中近乎赤裸地奋笔疾书，写下辛辣讽刺的文章，同时因其在报道中将当地居民蔑称为“乡巴佬”而激起公愤，甚至有人要将他赶出小镇。这反映了审判所引发的文化冲突之激烈。

6.  **"The oratorical storm that Clarence Darrow and Dudley Field Malone blew up in the little court in Dayton swept like a fresh wind through the schools and legislative offices of the United States, bringing in its wake a new climate of intellectual and academic freedom that has grown with the passing years."**

    -   **剖析**： 这是文章的总结句，也是一个结构极为复杂的长句，其难度在于一连串层层递进的隐喻。
        -   **主干**：“The...storm...swept like a fresh wind...bringing...a new climate...”。
        -   **隐喻链**：
            1.  **“Oratorical storm”**（辩论的风暴）：将丹诺和马龙在法庭上的激烈辩词比作一场“风暴”，强调其强大的冲击力和颠覆性。
            2.  **“swept like a fresh wind”**（像一阵清新的风扫过）：紧接着，这场“风暴”的影响又被比作“清新的风”，暗示它虽然猛烈，但其效果是积极的、涤荡污浊的，为社会带来了新生。
            3.  **“bringing in its wake”**（在其身后带来）：这个短语源自航海，指船只驶过留下的尾迹。这里延续了“风暴/风”的意象，表示“作为其结果”或“随之而来”。
            4.  **“a new climate of intellectual and academic freedom”**（一种思想和学术自由的新气候）：最终，这场风暴带来的长远影响被比作一种“新气候”。“气候”在此指一个时代或社会总体的、持久的氛围和环境。
        -   **综合**：整句话通过一个从“风暴”到“清风”再到“新气候”的完整隐喻链条，高度概括了这场审判的深远意义：丹诺等人的法庭辩论，其影响远远超出了戴顿小镇，它像一场涤荡全国的风暴，扫清了陈腐观念，最终在美国的教育界和立法界创造了一种全新的、持久的思想与学术自由的氛围。
