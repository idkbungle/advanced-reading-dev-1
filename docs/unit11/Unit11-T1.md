In the following essay, you can see how carefully the author describes the town and people of Dayton, Tennessee, so that the reader visualizes the setting in which the trial takes place. Description thus makes the narrative vivid: we live for a moment in that hurly-burly and watch the action of the trial unfold.

在下文中，你将看到作者如何细致入微地描摹田纳西州代顿镇的风土人情，令读者对庭审的背景有身临其境之感。正是这些描摹使得叙事生动鲜活：我们仿佛在那片喧嚣中亲历片刻，目睹庭审的剧情徐徐展开。

It was a strange trial. Into the quiet town of Dayton flocked gaunt Tennessee farmers and their families in mule-drawn wagons and ramshackle Fords; quiet, godly people in overalls and gingham and black, ready to defend their faith against the "foreigners," yet curious to know what this new-fangled evolutionary theory might be. Revivalists of every sort flocked there, too, held their meetings on the outskirts of the town under the light of flares, and tacked up signs on the trees about the courthouse—"Read Your Bible Daily for One Week," and "Be Sure Your Sins Will Find You Out," and at the very courthouse gate:

这是一场奇异的审判。田纳西州面容清癯的农民和家人，驾着骡车或开着破旧的福特车，涌入了宁静的代顿镇。这些民众安静而虔诚，身穿工装裤、方格布衣和黑衣，随时准备捍卫自己的信仰，抵御“外来者”，但又好奇这新奇的进化论究竟为何物。各路福音派布道者也蜂拥而至，在镇郊的火把光亮下举行集会，把标语牌钉在法院周围的树上——“坚持一周，每日诵读圣经”、“罪孽终将败露，望君好自为之”，而在法院大门口，赫然挂着这样一块牌子：

THE KINGDOM OF GOD
The sweetheart love of Jesus Christ and Paradise Street is at hand. Do you want to be a sweet angel? Forty days of prayer. Itemize your sins and iniquities for eternal life. If you come clean, God will talk back to you in a voice.

上帝之国
耶稣基督甜美的爱与天堂大道就在眼前。你想成为可爱的天使吗？祈祷四十天。为得永生，逐条列数你的罪愆。你若坦陈，上帝便会亲口回应你。

Yet the atmosphere of Dayton was not simply that of rural piety. Hot dog venders and lemonade venders set up their stalls along the streets as if it were circus day. Booksellers hawked volumes on biology. Over a hundred newspaper men poured into the town. The Western Union installed twenty-two telegraph operators in a room off a grocery store.

然而，代顿的氛围又非纯然的乡村之虔。卖热狗和柠檬水的小贩沿街设摊，仿佛镇上来了马戏团。书商们叫卖着生物学著作。一百多名新闻记者涌入小镇。西联电报公司在一家杂货店的附属房间里，安排了二十二名报务员。

In the courtroom itself, as the trial impended, reporters and camera men crowded alongside grim-faced Tennessee countrymen; there was a buzz of talk, a shuffle of feet, a ticking of telegraph instruments, an air of suspense like that of a first-night performance at the theater. Judge, defendant, and counsel were stripped to their shirt sleeves—Bryan in a pongee shirt turned in at the neck, Darrow with lavender suspenders, Judge Raulston with galluses of a more sober judicial hue—yet fashion was not wholly absent: the news was flashed over the wires to the whole country that the judge's daughters, as they entered the courtroom with him, wore rolled stockings like any metropolitan flappers. Court was opened with a pious prayer—and motion picture operators climbed upon tables and chairs to photograph the leading participants in the trial from every possible angle. The evidence ranged all the way from the admission of fourteen-year-old Howard Morgan that Scopes had told him about evolution and that it hadn't hurt him any, to the estimate of a zoologist that life had begun something like six hundred million years ago (an assertion which caused gasps and titters of disbelief from the rustics in the audience). And meanwhile two million words were being telegraphed out of Dayton, the trial was being broadcast by the Chicago Tribune's station WGN, the Dreamland Circus at Coney Island offered "Zip" to the Scopes defense as a "missing link," cable companies were reporting enormous increases in transatlantic cable tolls, and news agencies in London were being besieged with requests for more copy from Switzerland, Italy, Germany, Russia, China, and Japan. Ballyhoo had come to Dayton.

庭审在即，法庭之内，记者和摄影师们与面色严峻的田纳西乡民挤作一团；人声嗡嗡，脚步沓沓，电报机滴答作响，气氛紧张，宛如戏剧首演之夜。法官、被告和律师都脱下外衣，只穿着衬衫——布莱恩身着一件翻领庞吉绸衬衫，丹诺系着淡紫色背带，劳尔斯顿法官的背带则是色调更为庄重的司法色——但时尚也并非全无踪影：一则新闻通过电报传遍全国，说法官的女儿们随他步入法庭时，穿着和都市时髦女郎一样的卷边长袜。法庭在虔诚的祷告声中开庭——电影摄影师则爬上桌椅，从各种可能的角度为主要参与者拍照。呈堂的证据五花八门，从十四岁的霍华德·摩根承认斯科普斯曾告诉他进化论、而他并未因此受到任何伤害，到一位动物学家估计生命始于约六亿年前（这一论断引得听众席上的乡民们倒吸凉气，窃笑不已，以示不信）。与此同时，两百万字的电讯从代顿发出，审判由《芝加哥论坛报》的WGN电台进行广播，康尼岛的梦境马戏团甚至愿将小丑“齐普”作为“缺失的一环”提供给斯科普斯的辩护方，电报公司报告说跨大西洋电报业务量剧增，而伦敦的新闻机构则被来自瑞士、意大利、德国、俄国、中国和日本的稿件需求淹没。一场喧嚣的炒作降临代顿。

It was a bitter trial. Attorney-General Stewart of Tennessee cried out against the insidious doctrine which was "undermining the faith of Tennessee's children and robbing them of their chance of eternal life." Bryan charged Darrow with having only one purpose, "to slur at the Bible." Darrow spoke of Bryan's “fool religion.” Yet again and again the scene verged on farce. The climax—both of bitterness and of farce—came on the afternoon of July 20th, when on the spur of the moment Hays asked that the defense be permitted to put Bryan on the stand as an expert on the Bible, and Bryan consented.

这是一场激烈的审判。田纳西州总检察长斯图尔特大声疾呼，反对这种阴险的学说，称其“侵蚀田纳西州孩子们的信仰，剥夺他们获得永生的机会”。布莱恩指责丹诺只有一个目的，就是“诋毁《圣经》”。丹诺则称布莱恩的宗教为“愚蠢的宗教”。然而，庭审场面却一再濒临闹剧。这场既激烈又滑稽的审判，在7月20日下午达到了高潮。当时，海斯心血来潮，请求允许辩方传唤布莱恩作为《圣经》专家出庭作证，布莱恩竟同意了。

So great was the crowd that afternoon that the judge had decided to move the court outdoors, to a platform built against the courthouse under the maple trees. Benches were set out before it. The reporters sat on the benches, on the ground, anywhere, and scribbled their stories. On the outskirts of the seated crowd a throng stood in the hot sunlight which streamed down through the trees. And on the platform sat the shirt-sleeved Clarence Darrow, Bible on his knee, and put the Fundamentalist champion through one of the strangest examinations which ever took place in a court of law.

那天下午人山人海，法官决定将法庭移至室外，设在法院外枫树下的一个平台上。平台前摆放着长凳。记者们或坐长凳，或坐地上，随处而坐，奋笔疾书，撰写报道。在坐着的听众外围，一大群人站在透过树隙洒下的炎炎烈日里。平台上，身着衬衫的克拉伦斯·丹诺膝上放着一本《圣经》，对这位基要派的捍卫者进行了一场法律史上最离奇的诘问。

He asked Bryan about Jonah and the whale, Joshua and the sun, where Cain got his wife, the date of the Flood, the significance of the Tower of Babel. Bryan affirmed his belief that the world was created in 4004 B.C. and the Flood occurred in or about 2348 B.C.; that Eve was literally made out of Adam's rib; that the Tower of Babel was responsible for the diversity of languages in the world; and that a "big fish" had swallowed Jonah. When Darrow asked him if he had even discovered where Cain got his wife, Bryan answered: "No, sir; I leave the agnostics to hunt for her." When Darrow inquired, "Do you say you do not believe that there were any civilizations on this earth that reach back beyond five thousand years?" Bryan stoutly replied, "I am not satisfied by any evidence I have seen." Tempers were getting frazzled by the strain and the heat; once Darrow declared that his purpose in examining Bryan was "to show up Fundamentalism... to prevent bigots and ignoramuses from controlling the educational system of the United States," and Bryan jumped up, his face purple, and shook his fist at Darrow, crying, "To protect the word of God against the greatest atheist and agnostic in the United States!"

他问了布莱恩关于约拿与大鱼、约书亚与太阳、该隐的妻子从何而来、大洪水的日期以及巴别塔的意义。布莱恩申明他相信世界创于公元前4004年，大洪水发生于公元前2348年前后；夏娃确确实实是亚当的一根肋骨造的；巴别塔导致了世间语言的多样性；以及一条“大鱼”吞下了约拿。当丹诺问他是否曾考证过该隐的妻子来自何处时，布莱恩答道：“不，先生；我把这事留给不可知论者去找吧。”当丹诺追问：“你的意思是，你不相信地球上存在任何超过五千年的文明吗？”布莱恩坚定地回答：“我见过的证据没有一样能说服我。”紧张的气氛加上炎热的天气，让人们的脾气变得暴躁。丹诺一度宣称他诘问布莱恩的目的是“为了揭露基要主义的本质……为了防止偏执狂和无知之徒控制美国的教育体系”。布莱恩随即跳了起来，气得脸色发紫，他朝丹诺挥舞着拳头，大喊道：“是为了捍卫上帝的圣言，反对美国最猖獗的无神论者和不可知论者！”

It was a savage encounter, and a tragic one for the ex-Secretary of State. He was defending what he held most dear. He was making—though he did not know it—his last appearance before the great American public which had once done him honor (he died scarcely a week later). And he was being covered with humiliation. The sort of religious faith which he represented could not take the witness stand and face reason as a prosecutor.

这是一场野蛮的交锋，对这位前国务卿而言，也是一场悲剧。他捍卫的是自己最为珍视的东西。他当时并不知道，这是他在曾给予他无上荣耀的美国大众面前的最后一次亮相（不到一周后他便与世长辞）。而他却蒙受了奇耻大辱。他所代表的那种宗教信仰，是无法站上证人席，去直面理性如检察官般的盘问的。

On the morning of July 21st Judge Raulston mercifully refused to let the ordeal of Bryan continue and expunged the testimony of the previous afternoon. Scopes' lawyers had been unable to get any of their scientific evidence before the jury, and now they saw that their only chance of making the sort of defense they had planned for lay in giving up the case and bringing it before the Tennessee Supreme Court on appeal. Scopes was promptly found guilty and fined one hundred dollars. The State Supreme Court later upheld the anti-evolution law but freed Scopes on a technicality, thus preventing further appeal.

7月21日上午，劳尔斯顿法官发了慈悲，没有让布莱恩的磨难继续下去，并宣布前一天下午的证词无效。斯科普斯的律师们一直未能将任何科学证据呈交给陪审团，此时他们看到，要实现他们计划的那种辩护，唯一的机会就是放弃此案，转而向田纳西州最高法院上诉。斯科普斯随即被判有罪，罚款一百美元。州最高法院后来维持了反进化论法的效力，但因技术性问题释放了斯科普斯，从而阻止了后续上诉。

Theoretically, Fundamentalism had won, for the law stood. Yet really Fundamentalism had lost. Legislators might go on passing anti-evolution laws, and in the hinterlands the pious might still keep their religion locked in a science-proof compartment of their minds; but civilized opinion everywhere had regarded the Dayton trial with amazement and amusement, and the slow drift away from Fundamentalism certainly continued.

理论上，基要主义赢了，因为法律依然有效。但实际上，基要主义输了。立法者们或许会继续通过反进化论的法律，在穷乡僻壤，虔诚的信徒们或许仍会将宗教信仰锁在脑中一个科学无法触及的隔间里；但各地的文明社会都已对代顿审判报以惊奇与哂笑，而人们脱离基要主义的缓慢趋势，无疑仍在继续。

## Synthesis

**En**
 This essay vividly portrays the Scopes Trial in Dayton, Tennessee, depicting how a quiet town was transformed into a bizarre spectacle. It captures the clash of worlds as religious fundamentalists, national media, and commercial opportunists descended upon the scene. The narrative highlights the trial's strange atmosphere—a mix of pious revivalism, circus-like commercialism, and intense legal drama. The core conflict unfolds between prosecutor William Jennings Bryan, defending biblical literalism, and defense attorney Clarence Darrow, championing reason and science. The climax, Darrow's cross-examination of Bryan, publicly humiliated the fundamentalist leader. The author concludes that although Scopes was convicted, the trial was a major cultural defeat for Fundamentalism, diminishing its credibility in the eyes of the modern world.

 本文生动地描绘了发生在田纳西州代顿镇的斯科普斯审判案，展现了一个宁静小镇如何转变为一出光怪陆离的“奇观”。文章捕捉到了不同世界的碰撞：虔诚的原教旨主义者、全国性的媒体和投机的商贩蜂拥而至。叙事突出了审判现场的奇异氛围——一种混合了宗教复兴狂热、马戏团般喧嚣和激烈法律对抗的混合体。核心冲突在捍卫圣经字面主义的检察官威廉·詹宁斯·布莱恩与拥护理性和科学的辩护律师克拉伦斯·丹诺之间展开。审判的高潮——丹诺对布莱恩的交叉诘问，使这位原教旨主义领袖当众受辱。作者总结道，尽管斯科普斯最终被判有罪，但这次审判在文化上却是原教旨主义的一次惨败，削弱了其在现代世界眼中的公信力。

## Analysis

**Analysis**

1.  **"Into the quiet town of Dayton flocked gaunt Tennessee farmers and their families in mule-drawn wagons and ramshackle Fords; quiet, godly people in overalls and gingham and black, ready to defend their faith against the 'foreigners,' yet curious to know what this new-fangled evolutionary theory might be."**

-   剖析： 这是一个典型的倒装句，以介词短语“Into the quiet town of Dayton”开头，将谓语动词“flocked”（蜂拥而至）置于主语“gaunt Tennessee farmers and their families”（消瘦的田纳西农民及其家人）之前，以此来强调“涌入”这一动作的戏剧性和对小镇的冲击力。句子后半部分“quiet, godly people...”是一个同位语，对前面的“farmers and their families”进行补充说明，描绘了他们的外貌（穿着工装裤、格子布衣服和黑色服装）、身份（安静、虔诚）以及复杂的内心状态：他们一方面“ready to defend their faith”（准备捍卫信仰），对抗“foreigners”（外来者，指记者、律师等），另一方面又对“this new-fangled evolutionary theory”（这个新奇的进化论）感到好奇。这种矛盾心理深刻地揭示了传统与现代观念碰撞时，普通民众内心的挣扎与困惑。

2.  **"In the courtroom itself, as the trial impended, reporters and camera men crowded alongside grim-faced Tennessee countrymen; there was a buzz of talk, a shuffle of feet, a ticking of telegraph instruments, an air of suspense like that of a first-night performance at the theater."**

-   剖析： 此句通过一系列感官细节和精妙比喻，营造出审判现场紧张而又充满戏剧性的氛围。句子前半部分描绘了视觉上的对立：“reporters and camera men”（代表现代媒体）与“grim-faced Tennessee countrymen”（表情严峻的当地乡民）拥挤在一起。后半部分用一连串名词短语——“a buzz of talk”（嗡嗡的交谈声）、“a shuffle of feet”（拖沓的脚步声）、“a ticking of telegraph instruments”（电报机滴答作响）——通过听觉细节，生动地再现了现场的嘈杂与骚动，其中“电报机”的声音尤其点明了事件已成为全国焦点。句末的比喻“an air of suspense like that of a first-night performance at the theater”（一种悬念气氛，如同剧院首演之夜）是点睛之笔，它精准地揭示了这场审判的本质：它不仅是一场法律诉讼，更是一场万众瞩目、充满戏剧冲突的公开“表演”。

3.  **"The evidence ranged all the way from the admission of fourteen-year-old Howard Morgan that Scopes had told him about evolution and that it hadn't hurt him any, to the estimate of a zoologist that life had begun something like six hundred million years ago (an assertion which caused gasps and titters of disbelief from the rustics in the audience)."**

-   剖析： 这是一个结构极为复杂的长句，运用“from X to Y”的句式来展示证词范围的巨大跨度，从而凸显审判的荒诞性。 “X”部分是一个男孩天真朴素的证词，“that Scopes had told him...”和“that it hadn't hurt him any”是两个并列的宾语从句，说明他承认“斯科尔斯告诉过他进化论，而这并未对他造成任何伤害”。“Y”部分则是一个动物学家关于地球生命起源的科学估测，时间跨度长达“六亿年”。这两个极端（一个男孩的个人感受 vs. 宏大的科学论断）并置，形成了强烈的反差。括号内的非限制性定语从句进一步描绘了听众（rustics，指乡下人）听到此论断时的反应——“gasps and titters of disbelief”（倒吸凉气和窃笑不信），生动地暴露了科学与当地普遍认知之间的巨大鸿沟。

4.  **"Attorney-General Stewart of Tennessee cried out against the insidious doctrine which was 'undermining the faith of Tennessee's children and robbing them of their chance of eternal life.'"**

-   剖析： 此句的理解难点在于其充满情感煽动性的措辞和隐喻。“Insidious doctrine”指“阴险的、潜移默化的学说”，将进化论描绘成一种悄悄侵入、意图不轨的邪恶理论。后面的定语从句运用了两个极具冲击力的比喻：第一个是“undermining the faith”（动摇信仰），将“信仰”比作一座建筑的根基，而进化论正在暗中将其破坏；第二个是“robbing them of their chance of eternal life”（剥夺他们获得永生的机会），将“永生”比作一种宝贵的财产，而进化论则是一个将其抢走的“强盗”。这种表达方式完全脱离了理性辩论，旨在激发听众的恐惧和愤怒，是典型的宗教和政治煽动话术。

5.  **"The climax—both of bitterness and of farce—came on the afternoon of July 20th, when on the spur of the moment Hays asked that the defense be permitted to put Bryan on the stand as an expert on the Bible, and Bryan consented."**

-   剖析： 这句话的精髓在于破折号中的插入语“both of bitterness and of farce”（既是唇枪舌剑的顶点，也是一场闹剧的顶点）。这个评价一针见血地概括了接下来事件的双重属性。“Bitterness”（辛辣、尖刻）指向控辩双方激烈的个人攻击和意识形态对立；“farce”（闹剧）则指向整个场面的荒诞不经——让一位政治家以“圣经专家”的身份，在法庭上接受关于神话故事的质询。短语“on the spur of the moment”意为“一时冲动之下，心血来潮地”，说明这个决定是即兴的，更增添了其戏剧性和不可预测性。整个句子为下文那场著名的对质铺垫了基调：它既是严肃的信仰之战，也是一出滑稽的表演。

6.  **"Legislators might go on passing anti-evolution laws, and in the hinterlands the pious might still keep their religion locked in a science-proof compartment of their minds; but civilized opinion everywhere had regarded the Dayton trial with amazement and amusement, and the slow drift away from Fundamentalism certainly continued."**

-   剖析： 这是一个典型的复合句，通过转折连词“but”清晰地划分出两个层次的对比，从而引出作者的核心论点。前半部分描述了原教旨主义在表面上的“胜利”：政客们继续立法，而“hinterlands”（偏远地区）的“pious”（虔诚者）则继续固守信仰。此处的隐喻“keep their religion locked in a science-proof compartment of their minds”（将他们的宗教锁在脑中一个防科学的隔间里）极为深刻，它形象地描绘了“认知失调”或“思想隔绝”的状态——即为了避免内心冲突，人们将相互矛盾的信念（如宗教教条与科学事实）存放在大脑中互不相通的“隔间”里。后半部分则揭示了更深远的文化层面的“失败”：“civilized opinion”（文明世界的舆论）对这场审判感到“amazement and amusement”（惊奇又好笑），并且“the slow drift away from Fundamentalism”（缓慢脱离原教旨主义的趋势）仍在继续。这句话总结了审判的真正影响：法律上的小胜，难掩文化上的惨败。
